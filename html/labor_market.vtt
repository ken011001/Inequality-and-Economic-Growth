00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:03.360
Hello everyone. So now we

2
00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:05.920
enter chapter 7, start

3
00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:08.720
talking about the economy in the

4
00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:11.600
medium run. In this chapter,

5
00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:13.840
we will start with talking about the

6
00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:16.720
labor market. Ohh

7
00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:18.680
We will start have some brief

8
00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:21.600
introduction about the labor market.

9
00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:24.080
Then we talked about the unemployment,

10
00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:26.760
also unemployment rates and

11
00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:29.720
after that we will go insidethe

12
00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.760
supply and demand of the labor,

13
00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:35.440
which in the labor market context, we

14
00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:38.360
call it a wage determination and price

15
00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:40.921
determination. Ohh

16
00:00:41.681 --> 00:00:44.041
After that, we are building up the supply

17
00:00:44.041 --> 00:00:46.881
and demand for the labor. We will

18
00:00:47.041 --> 00:00:49.201
discuss the equilibrium of the labor

19
00:00:49.201 --> 00:00:52.121
market, which in turn direct us to the

20
00:00:52.561 --> 00:00:55.361
discussion about what we call natural

21
00:00:55.361 --> 00:00:56.241
rate of unemployment.

22
00:00:58.161 --> 00:01:01.121
After that, we will conclude this session

23
00:01:01.121 --> 00:01:03.761
by discussing how we

24
00:01:04.321 --> 00:01:06.401
incorporate labor market

25
00:01:07.041 --> 00:01:09.881
into the ISLM model

26
00:01:09.881 --> 00:01:12.641
that we have already built, which is only

27
00:01:12.641 --> 00:01:14.681
about the goods market and financial

28
00:01:14.681 --> 00:01:17.601
markets. After incorporating

29
00:01:17.601 --> 00:01:19.961
the labor market in the ISLM model, we

30
00:01:19.961 --> 00:01:21.001
will have the ohh

31
00:01:23.441 --> 00:01:26.401
extended ISLM model for the

32
00:01:26.401 --> 00:01:28.721
equilibrium. in the medium run.

33
00:01:35.041 --> 00:01:37.281
So about labor market.

34
00:01:38.481 --> 00:01:41.201
Before we are focusing only on short

35
00:01:41.201 --> 00:01:43.921
run, that we think

36
00:01:43.921 --> 00:01:46.801
about the supply of

37
00:01:46.881 --> 00:01:49.281
the total outputs are fixed

38
00:01:50.641 --> 00:01:52.961
uh in in the economy.

39
00:01:53.441 --> 00:01:56.241
Also, that leads towe

40
00:01:56.241 --> 00:01:58.522
assume that the price level doesn't

41
00:01:58.522 --> 00:02:01.482
change as well. But when we talked about

42
00:02:01.482 --> 00:02:03.442
the equilibrium in the medium run,

43
00:02:04.882 --> 00:02:07.682
we were going to incorporate the

44
00:02:07.682 --> 00:02:10.642
price change. Because in the medium

45
00:02:10.642 --> 00:02:12.642
run, the production can be changed.

46
00:02:14.162 --> 00:02:16.322
If we have change in production that we

47
00:02:16.322 --> 00:02:19.202
have change in supply, that will

48
00:02:19.202 --> 00:02:21.522
lead to the price we're going to change

49
00:02:21.522 --> 00:02:24.082
as well. So in the medium run,

50
00:02:24.482 --> 00:02:26.002
comparing to the short run

51
00:02:27.762 --> 00:02:28.482
we have

52
00:02:37.452 --> 00:02:38.812
in short run we have

53
00:02:47.512 --> 00:02:48.792
we have demand

54
00:02:52.392 --> 00:02:55.032
is viable

55
00:02:57.672 --> 00:02:58.392
plus supply

56
00:03:01.992 --> 00:03:02.792
is fixed

57
00:03:05.602 --> 00:03:07.762
Right. Also we have price

58
00:03:12.322 --> 00:03:14.242
supply is about production

59
00:03:27.503 --> 00:03:29.743
and so that's inflation

60
00:03:33.063 --> 00:03:34.943
which is the change of price

61
00:03:35.743 --> 00:03:38.663
is 0 in short run, but in the medium

62
00:03:38.663 --> 00:03:38.943
run.

63
00:03:49.443 --> 00:03:50.403
what happened

64
00:03:56.723 --> 00:03:58.483
about the supply

65
00:04:01.203 --> 00:04:04.043
will be viable so that the

66
00:04:04.163 --> 00:04:06.603
inflation and

67
00:04:06.603 --> 00:04:09.283
price will

68
00:04:09.363 --> 00:04:11.683
all be viable.

69
00:04:16.243 --> 00:04:19.083
Then price can be changing thatMeans the

70
00:04:19.203 --> 00:04:22.163
inflation could be not zero.

71
00:04:26.163 --> 00:04:28.323
Basically in medium run we have

72
00:04:28.883 --> 00:04:31.603
inflation. Inflation is basically change

73
00:04:31.603 --> 00:04:32.163
of price.

74
00:04:37.444 --> 00:04:40.164
OK. So that's the main contrast

75
00:04:40.724 --> 00:04:42.564
about the medium run and short run.

76
00:04:43.684 --> 00:04:45.844
OK and.

77
00:04:47.524 --> 00:04:49.604
Labor market is

78
00:04:49.924 --> 00:04:51.924
actually the center of

79
00:04:52.884 --> 00:04:55.844
all these events. Basically, for

80
00:04:55.844 --> 00:04:58.724
production, firms are going to need

81
00:04:59.204 --> 00:05:01.804
to hire people to

82
00:05:01.844 --> 00:05:04.324
produce things when the supply

83
00:05:04.884 --> 00:05:07.244
of the total output or production of the

84
00:05:07.284 --> 00:05:09.044
total output is changing.

85
00:05:10.164 --> 00:05:12.124
Down to the earth, it is because the

86
00:05:12.804 --> 00:05:15.364
labor market can be adjusted in the

87
00:05:15.364 --> 00:05:16.404
medium run as well.

88
00:05:18.644 --> 00:05:21.204
So let's talk about the labor market.

89
00:05:24.164 --> 00:05:26.884
So this is actually a kind of a

90
00:05:26.884 --> 00:05:29.444
review of the intermediate macro

91
00:05:30.244 --> 00:05:31.084
talking about

92
00:05:32.484 --> 00:05:35.244
population, labor force, employment,

93
00:05:35.284 --> 00:05:38.244
unemployment, right?So

94
00:05:38.244 --> 00:05:40.964
regarding um

95
00:05:42.724 --> 00:05:45.284
this non-institutional civilian

96
00:05:45.284 --> 00:05:46.084
population.

97
00:05:49.204 --> 00:05:50.084
Those are

98
00:05:51.605 --> 00:05:54.245
basically the amount of

99
00:05:54.845 --> 00:05:56.885
employed people plus

100
00:05:58.085 --> 00:06:00.965
unemployed people plus the people not

101
00:06:00.965 --> 00:06:03.765
in the labor force. So these are,

102
00:06:04.405 --> 00:06:07.285
by definition, 16 years of

103
00:06:07.285 --> 00:06:08.485
age and older

104
00:06:11.125 --> 00:06:13.205
residing within the US

105
00:06:13.845 --> 00:06:16.005
who is not in

106
00:06:16.645 --> 00:06:18.725
Institute institutions

107
00:06:19.045 --> 00:06:21.925
basically who are not

108
00:06:23.525 --> 00:06:24.485
in custody

109
00:06:28.725 --> 00:06:30.405
and who are not in their active duty.

110
00:06:32.325 --> 00:06:34.245
So regarding all these

111
00:06:34.245 --> 00:06:37.165
non-institutional civilian, we

112
00:06:37.165 --> 00:06:37.445
can

113
00:06:39.765 --> 00:06:42.325
categorize this group of people by

114
00:06:42.885 --> 00:06:45.365
whether they are in the labor force or

115
00:06:45.365 --> 00:06:47.925
not. Right. In the labor force we have

116
00:06:48.085 --> 00:06:50.165
employed people or unemployed people,

117
00:06:50.805 --> 00:06:53.725
right. So and this calculation we

118
00:06:53.725 --> 00:06:56.405
have introduced at the beginning

119
00:06:56.645 --> 00:06:57.845
of the class

120
00:06:59.125 --> 00:07:02.005
already, right. The unemployment rate

121
00:07:02.005 --> 00:07:04.885
is the amount of unemployed people

122
00:07:05.285 --> 00:07:06.805
over the labor force.

123
00:07:08.485 --> 00:07:10.806
The labor force participation rate is the

124
00:07:10.806 --> 00:07:13.766
amount of the labor force.

125
00:07:14.566 --> 00:07:17.486
over the non-institutional civilian

126
00:07:17.486 --> 00:07:20.326
population, right?So one

127
00:07:20.326 --> 00:07:23.286
is the percentage of U in

128
00:07:24.326 --> 00:07:27.126
E + U here. The other

129
00:07:27.126 --> 00:07:27.566
is the

130
00:07:29.926 --> 00:07:31.686
percentage of E + U

131
00:07:32.486 --> 00:07:35.046
in E + U + N.

132
00:07:36.806 --> 00:07:37.046
OK,

133
00:07:42.516 --> 00:07:43.916
so uh

134
00:07:46.836 --> 00:07:49.046
ifYou look

135
00:07:49.206 --> 00:07:50.966
deeper inside

136
00:07:51.926 --> 00:07:54.526
these amount of employment,

137
00:07:54.526 --> 00:07:56.966
unemployment and not in labor force.

138
00:08:01.926 --> 00:08:04.406
These are variables that

139
00:08:04.406 --> 00:08:05.446
actually

140
00:08:08.166 --> 00:08:11.126
sorry, these are

141
00:08:11.126 --> 00:08:12.166
actually stock

142
00:08:14.086 --> 00:08:14.886
variables.

143
00:08:19.846 --> 00:08:22.526
Right. Because by definition, they are

144
00:08:22.526 --> 00:08:25.406
telling you at this very moment how many

145
00:08:25.406 --> 00:08:27.727
people are employed or how many people

146
00:08:27.727 --> 00:08:30.287
are unemployed. They are stock

147
00:08:30.287 --> 00:08:30.887
variables.

148
00:08:38.447 --> 00:08:39.167
And because

149
00:08:41.887 --> 00:08:44.727
the composition of the unemployment rate

150
00:08:44.727 --> 00:08:47.487
and labor force participation rate are

151
00:08:47.487 --> 00:08:49.847
all from stock variables, that makes the.

152
00:08:52.807 --> 00:08:54.807
These two rates are

153
00:08:55.287 --> 00:08:58.247
also stock variable, that

154
00:08:58.807 --> 00:09:01.527
they are actually reflecting the

155
00:09:01.527 --> 00:09:02.087
stock

156
00:09:04.927 --> 00:09:06.487
of this economic situation.

157
00:09:10.487 --> 00:09:10.967
So

158
00:09:13.447 --> 00:09:16.007
that actually leads to another

159
00:09:16.407 --> 00:09:19.287
question. So we only know about the

160
00:09:19.287 --> 00:09:22.247
stock. In

161
00:09:22.367 --> 00:09:25.127
the labor market, how about the flows,

162
00:09:25.687 --> 00:09:27.927
right?Actually flow matters as well,

163
00:09:28.247 --> 00:09:30.527
right?If we only know about the

164
00:09:30.527 --> 00:09:33.447
unemployment rate, we don't

165
00:09:33.447 --> 00:09:36.327
actually know about it is because

166
00:09:36.567 --> 00:09:39.207
it is it because we have a lot of

167
00:09:39.927 --> 00:09:42.647
hires and separations. Separations

168
00:09:42.647 --> 00:09:45.608
here means that we have

169
00:09:46.168 --> 00:09:48.808
layouts and firing,

170
00:09:49.008 --> 00:09:51.888
OK. Is it

171
00:09:51.888 --> 00:09:54.088
because the we have a lot of people

172
00:09:54.088 --> 00:09:56.408
entering and exiting the unemployment

173
00:09:57.048 --> 00:09:59.768
or we have a just relatively

174
00:09:59.848 --> 00:10:02.568
less people entering or exiting

175
00:10:02.888 --> 00:10:05.128
unemployment, right?

176
00:10:06.408 --> 00:10:09.048
All this scenario could give you a same

177
00:10:09.608 --> 00:10:12.408
labor, sorry, unemployment rate.

178
00:10:12.968 --> 00:10:15.288
So only knowing the stock viable wouldn't

179
00:10:15.608 --> 00:10:18.368
give you the complete picture. of the

180
00:10:18.568 --> 00:10:21.448
labor market, we also need to know

181
00:10:21.448 --> 00:10:23.208
about the flows. Uh

182
00:10:24.888 --> 00:10:27.688
What is the situation of

183
00:10:27.688 --> 00:10:29.888
people flowing across different

184
00:10:30.248 --> 00:10:32.488
categories in the labor market?

185
00:10:34.888 --> 00:10:37.728
If we have a lot

186
00:10:37.848 --> 00:10:40.808
of people, if the flow is

187
00:10:40.808 --> 00:10:43.768
very huge, that couldn't that couldn't

188
00:10:43.768 --> 00:10:45.768
be a good thing.

189
00:10:46.648 --> 00:10:48.728
Right. That means we have a very high

190
00:10:48.728 --> 00:10:51.448
turnover rate in labor markets.

191
00:10:52.408 --> 00:10:55.208
People's jobs are very insecure.

192
00:10:57.848 --> 00:11:00.728
So only knowing

193
00:11:00.808 --> 00:11:03.168
all those unemployment rates wouldn't be

194
00:11:03.168 --> 00:11:05.129
enough to have the whole picture.

195
00:11:08.649 --> 00:11:11.369
So how do we know about the flows?This is

196
00:11:11.369 --> 00:11:14.169
also coming from the labor

197
00:11:14.169 --> 00:11:16.009
statistics by this.

198
00:11:17.129 --> 00:11:18.809
What we call the current population

199
00:11:18.809 --> 00:11:19.369
survey.

200
00:11:22.169 --> 00:11:23.689
Actually, I don't know whether you guys

201
00:11:23.689 --> 00:11:25.609
have this

202
00:11:28.089 --> 00:11:30.809
experience previously

203
00:11:31.289 --> 00:11:33.969
in your household. Sometimes you will

204
00:11:33.969 --> 00:11:36.729
receive this population

205
00:11:37.289 --> 00:11:40.009
survey questionnaire for the whole

206
00:11:40.009 --> 00:11:41.449
household and ask you.

207
00:11:43.529 --> 00:11:45.609
Your what was your

208
00:11:45.769 --> 00:11:48.369
occupation?How many?How many people in

209
00:11:48.369 --> 00:11:49.929
your household?How many child in the

210
00:11:49.929 --> 00:11:52.089
household?What's your income?

211
00:11:52.889 --> 00:11:55.609
Those are actually for actually

212
00:11:55.689 --> 00:11:58.249
this survey and actually for economist

213
00:11:58.649 --> 00:11:59.849
to analyze the whole

214
00:12:01.769 --> 00:12:03.649
labor situation and macroeconomic

215
00:12:03.649 --> 00:12:05.769
situation of the country.

216
00:12:06.969 --> 00:12:09.609
OK, so if next time you

217
00:12:09.609 --> 00:12:11.849
receive this kind of

218
00:12:12.009 --> 00:12:14.169
survey. take some time uh

219
00:12:15.849 --> 00:12:18.649
filling it out and and we will have a

220
00:12:18.649 --> 00:12:21.209
better information and data

221
00:12:21.770 --> 00:12:24.730
to make a good and appropriate

222
00:12:25.370 --> 00:12:26.010
policy.

223
00:12:32.440 --> 00:12:35.200
Okay, so the graph right-hand side

224
00:12:35.640 --> 00:12:38.240
represents not only the

225
00:12:38.280 --> 00:12:40.640
stock variables, but also the

226
00:12:40.640 --> 00:12:43.400
flows across

227
00:12:43.640 --> 00:12:45.640
these different categories.

228
00:12:47.050 --> 00:12:49.450
OK, so basically um

229
00:12:49.770 --> 00:12:50.410
from

230
00:12:52.050 --> 00:12:54.090
employment to

231
00:12:54.730 --> 00:12:56.490
out of labour force,

232
00:12:57.690 --> 00:13:00.330
main reason are retirement.

233
00:13:01.210 --> 00:13:03.570
OK, from out of labour force to

234
00:13:03.730 --> 00:13:06.410
employment, um

235
00:13:06.410 --> 00:13:09.290
mainly they are uh fresh graduates. They

236
00:13:09.290 --> 00:13:10.410
they could be other reasons

237
00:13:12.650 --> 00:13:15.330
um because at at the first the.

238
00:13:16.650 --> 00:13:19.210
Students are not count as

239
00:13:20.410 --> 00:13:22.370
in the labor force. They are out of labor

240
00:13:22.370 --> 00:13:25.050
force. OK. And

241
00:13:25.290 --> 00:13:27.530
from employment to

242
00:13:27.610 --> 00:13:29.770
unemployment, people

243
00:13:30.650 --> 00:13:33.530
got fired basically or they fire

244
00:13:33.530 --> 00:13:36.290
themselves. And

245
00:13:36.290 --> 00:13:39.130
from unemployment goes to employment,

246
00:13:39.290 --> 00:13:42.251
mainly the main reasons are people

247
00:13:42.891 --> 00:13:45.371
basically find a job OK and

248
00:13:45.771 --> 00:13:46.331
this.

249
00:13:48.091 --> 00:13:50.491
Self-directed arrow in the

250
00:13:51.011 --> 00:13:53.931
employment basically are

251
00:13:53.931 --> 00:13:56.051
about people switching to a new job

252
00:13:56.651 --> 00:13:59.611
without actually without any time that

253
00:13:59.611 --> 00:14:02.091
is unemployed. So they just

254
00:14:03.051 --> 00:14:05.851
switch to a new job like seamlessly.

255
00:14:07.851 --> 00:14:09.771
And from the out of labor force to

256
00:14:09.851 --> 00:14:12.651
unemployment, there are reasons of

257
00:14:13.771 --> 00:14:16.531
people are discouraged. So they

258
00:14:16.531 --> 00:14:19.331
stop searching for a job for a long time

259
00:14:19.451 --> 00:14:21.531
and they come come back

260
00:14:22.171 --> 00:14:25.051
searching for a job. At

261
00:14:25.291 --> 00:14:28.171
at the moment they restart

262
00:14:28.171 --> 00:14:30.971
searching, they become unemployed.

263
00:14:32.571 --> 00:14:32.971
OK,

264
00:14:35.451 --> 00:14:38.371
unless they go straight to the

265
00:14:39.411 --> 00:14:42.251
employment, right?So.

266
00:14:44.971 --> 00:14:47.531
For example, people

267
00:14:47.851 --> 00:14:50.811
that there's a firm just send

268
00:14:50.811 --> 00:14:53.611
you a letter, give you a job

269
00:14:53.611 --> 00:14:55.691
offer because like

270
00:14:57.051 --> 00:14:59.412
they know you beforehand and you decide

271
00:14:59.412 --> 00:15:01.852
to take the job. So right away you go

272
00:15:01.852 --> 00:15:04.092
from out of the labor force to

273
00:15:04.092 --> 00:15:04.812
unemployment.

274
00:15:06.972 --> 00:15:09.252
Conditional on previously you are not

275
00:15:09.252 --> 00:15:12.172
looking for a job for more than four

276
00:15:12.172 --> 00:15:14.812
weeks. And also for

277
00:15:14.812 --> 00:15:17.052
unemployment to out of labor force,

278
00:15:17.932 --> 00:15:20.572
basically main reasons are people

279
00:15:20.572 --> 00:15:23.172
stop searching, so they are they got

280
00:15:23.172 --> 00:15:25.172
discouraged. If

281
00:15:26.172 --> 00:15:29.132
they stop searching after four

282
00:15:29.132 --> 00:15:31.692
weeks, then they

283
00:15:31.692 --> 00:15:34.412
automatically also count in out of labor

284
00:15:34.412 --> 00:15:34.812
force.

285
00:15:37.452 --> 00:15:40.252
So some facts about

286
00:15:40.812 --> 00:15:43.372
the the US.

287
00:15:44.172 --> 00:15:46.652
in the recent 20 years. So the

288
00:15:46.652 --> 00:15:49.012
flows of workers in and out of the

289
00:15:49.012 --> 00:15:51.372
employment are large.

290
00:15:52.172 --> 00:15:54.492
So people are having

291
00:15:54.572 --> 00:15:57.012
reasons from

292
00:15:57.012 --> 00:15:59.332
employment to unemployment and employment

293
00:15:59.332 --> 00:16:00.612
to out of labor force. Ohh

294
00:16:02.332 --> 00:16:04.652
These are 1.8

295
00:16:05.292 --> 00:16:06.812
and 3.7

296
00:16:08.572 --> 00:16:10.652
millions. So that's

297
00:16:11.212 --> 00:16:13.532
summed together actually

298
00:16:13.852 --> 00:16:16.333
Counts nearly the

299
00:16:16.333 --> 00:16:18.773
amount of the unemployment

300
00:16:19.213 --> 00:16:21.773
stock, right?So.

301
00:16:22.993 --> 00:16:25.873
Flows in and out are large, and flows in

302
00:16:25.873 --> 00:16:28.353
and out of unemployment are also

303
00:16:28.353 --> 00:16:30.513
large relative to the number of

304
00:16:30.513 --> 00:16:33.313
unemployed, right?Coming

305
00:16:33.313 --> 00:16:36.113
about the outflow, either you got

306
00:16:36.113 --> 00:16:38.913
employed or you are discouraged

307
00:16:38.913 --> 00:16:41.153
to the not in the labor force.

308
00:16:43.313 --> 00:16:45.553
These two flows sums to be

309
00:16:45.673 --> 00:16:48.633
3.6, right?

310
00:16:49.473 --> 00:16:51.433
50% of the unemployment.

311
00:16:52.793 --> 00:16:55.713
unemployment stock and also

312
00:16:55.713 --> 00:16:57.153
the inflow from

313
00:16:58.313 --> 00:17:01.193
employed plus the inflow from the out

314
00:17:01.193 --> 00:17:03.553
of labor force together 3.8

315
00:17:04.193 --> 00:17:06.713
is also 50 percent

316
00:17:07.113 --> 00:17:09.633
of the unemployment stock. So

317
00:17:10.393 --> 00:17:12.513
what this really means is like

318
00:17:14.113 --> 00:17:15.313
for the whole pool

319
00:17:17.553 --> 00:17:20.433
almost half of it

320
00:17:21.873 --> 00:17:23.953
Every month, almost half of

321
00:17:24.593 --> 00:17:27.073
half of the whole pool

322
00:17:27.553 --> 00:17:30.393
will go from unemployed to

323
00:17:30.553 --> 00:17:33.393
employed or out of labor force will move

324
00:17:33.473 --> 00:17:35.834
up. And also 50%,

325
00:17:36.434 --> 00:17:38.954
almost 50% of the

326
00:17:39.234 --> 00:17:42.194
size of the stock will be moving. So

327
00:17:42.994 --> 00:17:45.314
unemployment is

328
00:17:47.674 --> 00:17:50.434
very unstable, right?We have a very high

329
00:17:50.434 --> 00:17:52.194
turnover. People

330
00:17:53.634 --> 00:17:56.274
become employed or people move out from

331
00:17:56.274 --> 00:17:58.914
the unemployment pretty frequently.

332
00:17:58.914 --> 00:18:00.754
People move in from unemployment

333
00:18:01.714 --> 00:18:04.634
pretty frequently, right?So it might

334
00:18:04.634 --> 00:18:07.394
be a good thing. It will be a good thing

335
00:18:07.394 --> 00:18:10.114
for the economy if people can move

336
00:18:10.194 --> 00:18:12.514
out from the unemployment, especially to

337
00:18:12.514 --> 00:18:15.474
the to employment easily, right?

338
00:18:15.474 --> 00:18:16.834
So that would be the

339
00:18:18.114 --> 00:18:20.914
ideal target policy for the.

340
00:18:21.474 --> 00:18:24.394
labor policy, right?And the labor

341
00:18:24.394 --> 00:18:26.914
policy also want to make

342
00:18:26.914 --> 00:18:28.754
people's job more stable.

343
00:18:30.274 --> 00:18:32.554
Right. To

344
00:18:33.314 --> 00:18:35.114
try, ideally want to decrease the

345
00:18:36.354 --> 00:18:38.554
inflow to the unemployment,

346
00:18:39.154 --> 00:18:40.514
sorry, the the people.

347
00:18:41.874 --> 00:18:43.794
Move from employed to unemployed.

348
00:18:46.714 --> 00:18:49.634
OK, so the third observation

349
00:18:49.634 --> 00:18:52.035
will beThere are also large flows in

350
00:18:52.595 --> 00:18:55.555
in and out of the labor force, much of

351
00:18:55.635 --> 00:18:58.235
it directly to and from employment.

352
00:18:58.755 --> 00:19:01.675
So in and out

353
00:19:01.675 --> 00:19:03.315
of the labor force means that

354
00:19:04.835 --> 00:19:07.275
in and out of employed and

355
00:19:07.475 --> 00:19:09.635
unemployed, right?So

356
00:19:09.875 --> 00:19:12.755
basically we are looking from, if it is

357
00:19:12.835 --> 00:19:15.235
in, then we are looking from

358
00:19:15.795 --> 00:19:18.275
this and this flow.

359
00:19:18.755 --> 00:19:20.795
If it's out, we're looking for this and

360
00:19:21.635 --> 00:19:22.155
this flow.

361
00:19:33.565 --> 00:19:35.885
Many people are classified as

362
00:19:35.965 --> 00:19:38.445
out-of-labor force, in fact, discouraged

363
00:19:38.445 --> 00:19:41.165
workers. They are not actively looking

364
00:19:41.165 --> 00:19:43.805
for a job, but we'll take it if they

365
00:19:43.805 --> 00:19:44.525
find one.

366
00:19:47.565 --> 00:19:49.405
Rather than unemployment rate,

367
00:19:50.955 --> 00:19:52.555
economics sometimes focus on the

368
00:19:52.875 --> 00:19:54.795
employment rate, the

369
00:19:54.795 --> 00:19:56.515
ratio

370
00:19:58.035 --> 00:19:58.835
of the employment

371
00:20:01.315 --> 00:20:02.515
to the whole population.

372
00:20:09.695 --> 00:20:11.376
These are purely from

373
00:20:13.536 --> 00:20:16.216
human definition. Uh

374
00:20:18.736 --> 00:20:21.456
Because the employment rates will

375
00:20:21.456 --> 00:20:24.436
have thebase regarding the whole

376
00:20:24.436 --> 00:20:26.276
population, so it is not

377
00:20:28.756 --> 00:20:31.236
not one minus unemployment rate. So

378
00:20:31.396 --> 00:20:32.756
this is something that

379
00:20:36.516 --> 00:20:39.396
you need to pay attention.

380
00:20:41.076 --> 00:20:42.996
Because unemployment rate

381
00:20:43.956 --> 00:20:46.676
is the unemployed over the

382
00:20:46.676 --> 00:20:49.236
total labor force.

383
00:20:50.596 --> 00:20:51.396
Okay, so

384
00:20:53.796 --> 00:20:55.316
The denominator is different.

385
00:21:01.766 --> 00:21:04.686
OK, uh you can take a closer look on

386
00:21:04.686 --> 00:21:07.566
the current population survey. So

387
00:21:07.566 --> 00:21:10.086
this is the main source of the

388
00:21:10.526 --> 00:21:13.246
government to specific

389
00:21:13.246 --> 00:21:16.046
labor department

390
00:21:16.926 --> 00:21:19.486
and also Department of Trade and

391
00:21:19.486 --> 00:21:21.636
Commerce. To know about the

392
00:21:21.636 --> 00:21:23.716
macroeconomic situation and

393
00:21:23.996 --> 00:21:26.356
unemployment, the labor market is the key

394
00:21:26.556 --> 00:21:29.317
factor of the country's

395
00:21:29.317 --> 00:21:30.757
macroeconomic performance.

396
00:21:31.957 --> 00:21:34.917
So all those

397
00:21:34.917 --> 00:21:37.877
labor force participation

398
00:21:37.877 --> 00:21:39.637
rate, the amount of labor force

399
00:21:39.677 --> 00:21:41.877
unemployment, all these labor

400
00:21:41.877 --> 00:21:44.837
statistics are actually based on the

401
00:21:44.837 --> 00:21:47.637
calculation from the labor current

402
00:21:47.637 --> 00:21:50.597
population survey. So it

403
00:21:50.597 --> 00:21:52.877
has several different

404
00:21:54.677 --> 00:21:56.517
kinds of survey that's

405
00:21:56.997 --> 00:21:59.957
included. Some are more frequent.

406
00:22:00.277 --> 00:22:02.677
You ask a selection, a

407
00:22:02.997 --> 00:22:05.237
random selection of households to send

408
00:22:05.237 --> 00:22:08.117
out e-mail, send out basically

409
00:22:08.117 --> 00:22:10.997
letters. So a

410
00:22:10.997 --> 00:22:13.557
paper questionnaire asks people to fill

411
00:22:13.557 --> 00:22:16.197
out the data. And there

412
00:22:16.437 --> 00:22:19.237
are other kind of survey

413
00:22:20.077 --> 00:22:22.437
That is asking shorter

414
00:22:23.237 --> 00:22:26.197
smaller amount of questions but sent

415
00:22:26.197 --> 00:22:27.797
out to a larger

416
00:22:28.837 --> 00:22:31.637
population of household in the less

417
00:22:31.637 --> 00:22:34.597
frequent time to to to have a more macro

418
00:22:34.917 --> 00:22:35.237
data

419
00:22:38.437 --> 00:22:41.157
that is not that precise about

420
00:22:41.317 --> 00:22:43.957
wage unemployment but

421
00:22:44.037 --> 00:22:45.157
more about.

422
00:22:49.398 --> 00:22:51.678
specific topics about

423
00:22:52.598 --> 00:22:55.558
well-being, mental health, et cetera. So

424
00:22:55.558 --> 00:22:58.358
they have main

425
00:22:58.518 --> 00:23:00.918
rounds of the survey and also supplement

426
00:23:00.998 --> 00:23:02.998
surveys for the CPS.

427
00:23:04.512 --> 00:23:07.312
So as we have a brief understanding

428
00:23:07.312 --> 00:23:10.112
about the labor market, let's go straight

429
00:23:10.592 --> 00:23:13.472
into unemployment. So

430
00:23:13.472 --> 00:23:16.232
this is the data that we plot the

431
00:23:16.312 --> 00:23:18.793
unemployment rate across time.

432
00:23:20.193 --> 00:23:22.913
As you can see, it's actually pretty

433
00:23:22.913 --> 00:23:25.313
fluctuated, right?And

434
00:23:26.433 --> 00:23:27.633
And you may notice

435
00:23:31.553 --> 00:23:34.113
all this shaded bar,This shaded

436
00:23:34.113 --> 00:23:36.433
bar, this shaded period actually

437
00:23:36.433 --> 00:23:39.153
indicates the US economy

438
00:23:39.313 --> 00:23:41.233
is in a recession.

439
00:23:42.513 --> 00:23:45.033
So then combining these two, the

440
00:23:45.033 --> 00:23:47.833
fluctuation of the unemployment rates and

441
00:23:47.833 --> 00:23:49.793
the recession periods,

442
00:23:50.753 --> 00:23:52.113
you're going to notice that the

443
00:23:52.793 --> 00:23:54.673
unemployment rates go up

444
00:23:55.633 --> 00:23:58.274
when the economy is in recession,

445
00:23:58.834 --> 00:24:01.794
go down when the economies was.

446
00:24:03.874 --> 00:24:06.594
Was out of recession. OK,

447
00:24:07.474 --> 00:24:10.194
this is actually reflecting that

448
00:24:11.634 --> 00:24:14.514
a pretty simple logic. If we have

449
00:24:14.754 --> 00:24:17.394
firms and overall

450
00:24:18.194 --> 00:24:20.994
macroeconomic is not performing well, so

451
00:24:20.994 --> 00:24:22.274
the firm cannot sell.

452
00:24:23.794 --> 00:24:26.274
If firm cannot sell, then they

453
00:24:26.274 --> 00:24:26.794
must

454
00:24:29.394 --> 00:24:31.634
cut down their production. If they cut

455
00:24:31.634 --> 00:24:33.234
down their production, they have to lay

456
00:24:33.234 --> 00:24:36.194
off their workers. So people

457
00:24:36.834 --> 00:24:39.315
there will be more people out of walk.

458
00:24:39.955 --> 00:24:41.635
In that sense, the

459
00:24:43.395 --> 00:24:45.155
unemployment rates will go up,

460
00:24:46.835 --> 00:24:48.675
right?And On the contrary,

461
00:24:49.315 --> 00:24:51.355
when the macroeconomic

462
00:24:52.115 --> 00:24:54.595
was doing good, the firm

463
00:24:54.595 --> 00:24:57.315
is expanding. So

464
00:24:57.315 --> 00:24:59.715
that they would need to hire more

465
00:24:59.715 --> 00:25:02.195
people. So more people will get a job

466
00:25:02.835 --> 00:25:05.715
and unemployment rates will go

467
00:25:05.715 --> 00:25:08.195
down, right?This is pretty

468
00:25:09.155 --> 00:25:11.315
if you look at the reality data,

469
00:25:14.755 --> 00:25:17.556
the hiring in the tech firms for

470
00:25:18.756 --> 00:25:21.716
computer scientists, data scientists

471
00:25:21.716 --> 00:25:24.356
actually pretty reflects

472
00:25:24.356 --> 00:25:25.636
this logic.

473
00:25:27.796 --> 00:25:30.036
So when several years

474
00:25:30.036 --> 00:25:32.596
before, when the tech

475
00:25:32.836 --> 00:25:34.796
industry was doing very good, when the

476
00:25:34.796 --> 00:25:37.636
economy was doing well because

477
00:25:37.756 --> 00:25:40.276
of the stimulus

478
00:25:40.356 --> 00:25:43.196
from the COVID

479
00:25:43.196 --> 00:25:45.996
relief plan, the tech firms actually

480
00:25:45.996 --> 00:25:48.556
hiring a lot of computer scientists and

481
00:25:49.156 --> 00:25:50.836
data scientists.

482
00:25:52.196 --> 00:25:55.156
But if you look at it recently, OK,

483
00:25:55.396 --> 00:25:58.037
the economy's not doing good. Tech firms

484
00:25:58.037 --> 00:26:00.757
are shrinking their size. The first round

485
00:26:00.797 --> 00:26:03.317
of layoff will be this

486
00:26:04.997 --> 00:26:05.797
actual

487
00:26:09.317 --> 00:26:12.117
computer scientist that actually hiring

488
00:26:12.117 --> 00:26:15.077
during the expansion, right?The

489
00:26:15.077 --> 00:26:17.917
firm we're gonna need to. Keep a lower

490
00:26:17.917 --> 00:26:20.837
amount of them to to maintain the will

491
00:26:20.837 --> 00:26:22.597
be enough for them to maintain the daily

492
00:26:22.597 --> 00:26:24.917
operation. Right now

493
00:26:25.717 --> 00:26:28.357
they're not in the expanding phrases, so

494
00:26:28.757 --> 00:26:30.317
those people who hired during the

495
00:26:30.317 --> 00:26:32.717
expanding phrases will be laid off

496
00:26:33.477 --> 00:26:36.397
right at the first round, right?

497
00:26:36.397 --> 00:26:39.318
So this is pretty brutal, but ohh

498
00:26:39.318 --> 00:26:41.958
it reflects the

499
00:26:42.278 --> 00:26:45.158
fundamentals of macroeconomics. OK,

500
00:26:45.158 --> 00:26:47.118
so this is about. the

501
00:26:47.718 --> 00:26:50.518
fluctuation of unemployment over time.

502
00:26:52.278 --> 00:26:54.198
So let's dive in a little bit.

503
00:26:55.398 --> 00:26:57.718
So this is the data of

504
00:26:58.238 --> 00:27:00.598
unemployment rate and the

505
00:27:00.598 --> 00:27:03.158
proportion of unemployed

506
00:27:03.318 --> 00:27:06.198
become employed within a month. So

507
00:27:08.998 --> 00:27:11.958
unemployed become employed will be

508
00:27:11.958 --> 00:27:14.918
the flow from unemployed to employed,

509
00:27:14.998 --> 00:27:17.879
right?SoIf we go back to the graph,

510
00:27:19.239 --> 00:27:21.879
I'm giving out these numbers

511
00:27:22.759 --> 00:27:24.679
to indicate the flow. So

512
00:27:26.039 --> 00:27:28.919
from unemployed to employed will be

513
00:27:28.919 --> 00:27:31.879
flow two, right?

514
00:27:32.599 --> 00:27:35.479
And that's we we call

515
00:27:35.479 --> 00:27:37.639
it a proportion, so it will be

516
00:27:39.799 --> 00:27:42.679
dividing by the origin

517
00:27:42.919 --> 00:27:45.759
of this flow. So this is a. The

518
00:27:45.879 --> 00:27:48.159
numerator is a flow variable, the

519
00:27:48.279 --> 00:27:49.559
denominator is the

520
00:27:51.319 --> 00:27:54.039
stock variable. So at the end, the whole

521
00:27:54.039 --> 00:27:56.759
term is actually a flow variable,

522
00:27:56.919 --> 00:27:59.800
right?So if we

523
00:27:59.800 --> 00:28:02.760
plot this change of

524
00:28:02.760 --> 00:28:05.480
the stock variable, sorry, we

525
00:28:05.480 --> 00:28:07.960
plot this stock variable versus this

526
00:28:08.440 --> 00:28:10.280
flow variable, see what's going on.

527
00:28:12.840 --> 00:28:15.240
They actually shares the same.

528
00:28:15.720 --> 00:28:18.520
Tendency, but keep a close eye

529
00:28:19.160 --> 00:28:22.040
is the proportion

530
00:28:22.520 --> 00:28:24.440
of unemployed become employed

531
00:28:25.080 --> 00:28:28.040
is plotting in

532
00:28:28.040 --> 00:28:30.680
a reverse y-axis.

533
00:28:31.080 --> 00:28:33.400
So it is getting bigger and bigger

534
00:28:37.241 --> 00:28:39.881
from top to the top to the bottom.

535
00:28:40.921 --> 00:28:43.481
OK, but they all they actually

536
00:28:43.481 --> 00:28:44.321
shows a.

537
00:28:46.761 --> 00:28:49.241
A cold movement, a strong cold movement.

538
00:28:49.801 --> 00:28:52.441
OK, so when the unemployment rate is

539
00:28:52.441 --> 00:28:52.921
higher,

540
00:28:55.801 --> 00:28:58.041
the proportion of unemployed become

541
00:28:58.041 --> 00:29:01.001
employed become lower.

542
00:29:01.161 --> 00:29:01.801
It is

543
00:29:04.041 --> 00:29:05.601
going up, but the

544
00:29:07.161 --> 00:29:09.561
scale is going down. OK,

545
00:29:11.401 --> 00:29:14.121
So what this

546
00:29:14.121 --> 00:29:15.081
actually tells you.

547
00:29:17.722 --> 00:29:20.362
Think about it, when the unemployment

548
00:29:20.602 --> 00:29:23.082
is higher, then

549
00:29:24.442 --> 00:29:26.682
the yield rate is

550
00:29:29.802 --> 00:29:32.202
high or increasing,

551
00:29:33.562 --> 00:29:36.122
then it means the labor

552
00:29:36.122 --> 00:29:36.682
market

553
00:29:39.722 --> 00:29:41.042
is pretty competitive.

554
00:29:48.362 --> 00:29:49.882
then what that leads to?It

555
00:30:13.413 --> 00:30:14.933
will actually makes

556
00:30:16.053 --> 00:30:16.853
people

557
00:30:21.573 --> 00:30:24.533
hard to

558
00:30:25.413 --> 00:30:26.493
find a job.

559
00:30:30.213 --> 00:30:31.173
So lower

560
00:30:33.173 --> 00:30:34.293
yield to e-flow.

561
00:30:41.004 --> 00:30:43.444
Right. You can stop at here a little bit

562
00:30:43.444 --> 00:30:46.284
to think about the logic. OK,

563
00:30:46.284 --> 00:30:46.924
let's move on.

564
00:30:49.804 --> 00:30:52.044
So here is another sense of the data. It

565
00:30:52.764 --> 00:30:55.004
is still plotting the unemployment rate

566
00:30:55.884 --> 00:30:58.444
versus another flow

567
00:30:58.604 --> 00:31:01.324
variable, which is the proportion of

568
00:31:01.324 --> 00:31:03.724
workers become unemployed.

569
00:31:06.924 --> 00:31:09.644
So if you look at. So

570
00:31:09.724 --> 00:31:12.004
we are here talking about the proportion

571
00:31:12.004 --> 00:31:14.524
of workers become unemployed. So it will

572
00:31:14.524 --> 00:31:17.325
be the flow of

573
00:31:17.765 --> 00:31:20.165
employed become unemployed. And

574
00:31:20.925 --> 00:31:22.045
go back to the graph.

575
00:31:23.885 --> 00:31:26.645
This will be the flow 1, right,

576
00:31:26.645 --> 00:31:28.605
from employed to unemployed.

577
00:31:31.805 --> 00:31:34.125
And divided by-- it is talking about

578
00:31:34.125 --> 00:31:36.605
proportion divided by the origin of the

579
00:31:36.605 --> 00:31:39.165
stock. Divided by the employed

580
00:31:40.285 --> 00:31:43.165
population. Then this flow

581
00:31:43.165 --> 00:31:45.485
variables comparing with the

582
00:31:46.725 --> 00:31:47.805
unemployment rates,

583
00:31:51.245 --> 00:31:53.645
they also show a very, very strong

584
00:31:53.645 --> 00:31:56.285
co-movement. OK and and

585
00:31:57.646 --> 00:32:00.606
the scale is reversed to the original

586
00:32:00.606 --> 00:32:03.366
scale, right?The the the

587
00:32:03.886 --> 00:32:05.726
proportion of workers become unemployed

588
00:32:05.726 --> 00:32:07.006
is higher.

589
00:32:11.486 --> 00:32:14.446
If the the the value is more to

590
00:32:14.446 --> 00:32:17.406
the top, OK, so they

591
00:32:17.406 --> 00:32:20.126
have the call movement and actually

592
00:32:20.126 --> 00:32:22.926
basically the graph is telling you when

593
00:32:22.926 --> 00:32:25.006
unemployment rate is high, high

594
00:32:25.006 --> 00:32:27.166
proportion of workers account unemployed

595
00:32:27.646 --> 00:32:29.406
and this is also

596
00:32:31.806 --> 00:32:34.766
coming with the similar logic that we

597
00:32:34.766 --> 00:32:36.886
have. talked about in the previous

598
00:32:36.886 --> 00:32:39.727
slides. So for example,

599
00:32:40.767 --> 00:32:43.047
we are talking about higher unemployment

600
00:32:43.047 --> 00:32:45.647
rate. Still, that

601
00:32:45.807 --> 00:32:48.247
means that the labor market is more

602
00:32:48.247 --> 00:32:49.007
competitive

603
00:33:00.507 --> 00:33:01.867
and that will lead

604
00:33:11.777 --> 00:33:12.417
people

605
00:33:15.497 --> 00:33:16.857
to lose their job

606
00:33:21.538 --> 00:33:21.938
easier.

607
00:33:25.408 --> 00:33:27.088
Right. So the flow

608
00:33:30.528 --> 00:33:33.488
from E to U,

609
00:33:34.528 --> 00:33:34.928
sorry.

610
00:33:42.788 --> 00:33:45.108
Anyway, you can pause this

611
00:33:45.748 --> 00:33:48.388
a little bit to digest.

612
00:33:49.588 --> 00:33:52.428
So let me recap a little bit. What do you

613
00:33:52.428 --> 00:33:54.468
mean by labor market more competitive?

614
00:33:56.928 --> 00:33:59.169
The more competitive labor market means

615
00:33:59.169 --> 00:34:01.089
that we we are looking from the

616
00:34:01.089 --> 00:34:03.969
perspective of worker

617
00:34:04.129 --> 00:34:05.529
labor supplier, right?

618
00:34:07.169 --> 00:34:09.009
The market is more competitive means you

619
00:34:09.009 --> 00:34:11.969
have more competitors, more

620
00:34:11.969 --> 00:34:14.929
people are fighting if OK,

621
00:34:15.249 --> 00:34:16.929
for example, if you don't have a job

622
00:34:16.929 --> 00:34:19.089
right now, more people are

623
00:34:19.649 --> 00:34:22.289
more, more people are in the same shoe

624
00:34:22.609 --> 00:34:25.289
as you. They are also fighting for a job.

625
00:34:25.489 --> 00:34:28.089
So there are more people fighting for for

626
00:34:28.089 --> 00:34:29.689
one job that the

627
00:34:30.369 --> 00:34:33.249
probability of you to get the job will

628
00:34:33.249 --> 00:34:35.729
be very low, right?I mean

629
00:34:37.249 --> 00:34:39.690
the probability will be decreasing with

630
00:34:39.810 --> 00:34:41.090
the amount of people

631
00:34:43.570 --> 00:34:46.530
is competing, right?With more people

632
00:34:46.530 --> 00:34:48.410
is competing, right?

633
00:34:50.130 --> 00:34:52.770
And from another. Side of the

634
00:34:52.770 --> 00:34:54.650
market, if you have a job

635
00:34:56.130 --> 00:34:58.770
and the labor market is more competitive

636
00:34:59.090 --> 00:34:59.890
means that

637
00:35:04.050 --> 00:35:06.930
you can think of the same as many people

638
00:35:06.930 --> 00:35:09.090
are actually fighting for your position.

639
00:35:10.210 --> 00:35:11.890
So there will be more

640
00:35:12.930 --> 00:35:15.170
with more people that will be more

641
00:35:15.490 --> 00:35:17.370
likely that you will going to lose your

642
00:35:17.370 --> 00:35:20.291
job. OK. So that's one one way

643
00:35:20.291 --> 00:35:22.131
to see it. Another way would be

644
00:35:22.771 --> 00:35:23.851
from the

645
00:35:26.291 --> 00:35:29.171
cost cutting point of view

646
00:35:29.171 --> 00:35:32.131
is like it is a more

647
00:35:32.131 --> 00:35:34.451
competitive labor market. Firms

648
00:35:35.091 --> 00:35:37.651
will want to shrink their production, cut

649
00:35:37.651 --> 00:35:40.411
some position, right. And then in that

650
00:35:40.411 --> 00:35:43.251
sense, the probability

651
00:35:43.331 --> 00:35:46.211
of you losing your position will

652
00:35:46.211 --> 00:35:49.171
be higher. Right. So either

653
00:35:49.171 --> 00:35:52.051
way it comes with the same

654
00:35:52.051 --> 00:35:54.851
kind of logic that's more competitive

655
00:35:55.571 --> 00:35:57.892
labor market that means so more

656
00:35:57.892 --> 00:36:00.012
competition we we are facing the

657
00:36:01.252 --> 00:36:03.452
from our point of view the

658
00:36:05.652 --> 00:36:07.972
benefits will be

659
00:36:08.212 --> 00:36:09.972
less, the cost will be more,

660
00:36:11.572 --> 00:36:13.812
the probability of

661
00:36:14.292 --> 00:36:17.252
surviving will be lower, OK.

662
00:36:18.772 --> 00:36:20.932
So we need to keep this in mind.

663
00:36:22.372 --> 00:36:23.972
We will already

664
00:36:25.572 --> 00:36:28.452
revisit this material

665
00:36:28.852 --> 00:36:31.772
when we talked about the wage setting.

666
00:36:35.172 --> 00:36:38.053
OK, so here again,

667
00:36:38.213 --> 00:36:40.293
when unemployment rate is high,

668
00:36:41.013 --> 00:36:43.013
workers are worse off in two ways,

669
00:36:44.213 --> 00:36:46.973
employed. will be more

670
00:36:46.973 --> 00:36:49.173
likely to get unemployed.

671
00:36:49.333 --> 00:36:52.213
Unemployed will be less

672
00:36:52.213 --> 00:36:55.093
likely to be employed, basically.

673
00:36:58.773 --> 00:37:01.053
So now that we have talked about the

674
00:37:02.853 --> 00:37:05.573
labor market movement,

675
00:37:05.573 --> 00:37:08.173
the fundamental logic of the

676
00:37:08.373 --> 00:37:11.013
labor market, we will go

677
00:37:11.013 --> 00:37:13.853
straight into what we call wage

678
00:37:13.853 --> 00:37:16.453
determination. So this is

679
00:37:16.453 --> 00:37:19.294
actually from the point of view from the

680
00:37:19.414 --> 00:37:21.174
workers, OK.

681
00:37:23.014 --> 00:37:25.894
We are actually the supplier of

682
00:37:25.894 --> 00:37:28.774
labor. Firms are actually the consumer of

683
00:37:28.774 --> 00:37:31.094
labor. They are buying our services and

684
00:37:31.094 --> 00:37:32.454
we are selling our services

685
00:37:33.974 --> 00:37:36.934
and the price of the services

686
00:37:37.494 --> 00:37:40.334
that we are talking in this

687
00:37:40.334 --> 00:37:42.374
market, like the the service that has

688
00:37:42.374 --> 00:37:44.534
changed in this market.

689
00:37:47.254 --> 00:37:49.494
Will be labor and the price of the labor,

690
00:37:49.494 --> 00:37:51.654
we call it wage. OK. So

691
00:37:52.134 --> 00:37:54.934
here the wage determination is actually

692
00:37:54.934 --> 00:37:57.735
from the supplier side telling us

693
00:37:57.815 --> 00:37:59.895
our willingness to sell,

694
00:38:01.575 --> 00:38:04.375
telling us the workers' willingness to

695
00:38:04.375 --> 00:38:06.855
sell their labor. OK.

696
00:38:07.655 --> 00:38:10.415
So besides the labor

697
00:38:10.415 --> 00:38:12.215
market situation that we have talked

698
00:38:12.215 --> 00:38:14.935
about. There are several other

699
00:38:15.255 --> 00:38:17.815
factors that could impact

700
00:38:19.415 --> 00:38:21.255
workers' willingness to sell.

701
00:38:22.535 --> 00:38:25.255
So we will talk about this extra factor

702
00:38:25.255 --> 00:38:28.215
1st and then we go back to form the

703
00:38:28.775 --> 00:38:31.655
basic supply and demand. Basically here

704
00:38:31.655 --> 00:38:34.575
we talk about the supply first, right.

705
00:38:35.815 --> 00:38:38.536
So about other factors that will change

706
00:38:38.616 --> 00:38:41.576
the labor supply, the first will be what

707
00:38:41.576 --> 00:38:43.136
we call collective bargaining.

708
00:38:45.176 --> 00:38:47.176
So basically, all else equal,

709
00:38:47.976 --> 00:38:49.856
if we have a

710
00:38:50.136 --> 00:38:52.536
stronger collective bargaining,

711
00:38:53.816 --> 00:38:56.616
the workers' willingness to sell will be

712
00:38:56.776 --> 00:38:58.616
higher. So what?

713
00:38:59.416 --> 00:39:01.016
What is collective bargaining?

714
00:39:02.296 --> 00:39:04.456
So think about the reality.

715
00:39:05.336 --> 00:39:07.576
A firm is hiring

716
00:39:08.696 --> 00:39:11.496
many workers, so it. It is.

717
00:39:11.936 --> 00:39:14.456
It is many

718
00:39:14.456 --> 00:39:16.136
versus one situation.

719
00:39:18.857 --> 00:39:21.017
And if the workers are actually

720
00:39:21.017 --> 00:39:23.977
negotiating with the firm for their

721
00:39:23.977 --> 00:39:26.777
wage one, one versus

722
00:39:26.777 --> 00:39:29.097
one, then

723
00:39:30.217 --> 00:39:31.737
the workers actually

724
00:39:35.017 --> 00:39:37.897
could have higher bargaining power

725
00:39:37.897 --> 00:39:40.857
if many workers unite together.

726
00:39:42.537 --> 00:39:44.537
OK, so if there are many workers are

727
00:39:44.537 --> 00:39:45.577
united cater

728
00:39:46.937 --> 00:39:49.897
negotiating for

729
00:39:49.897 --> 00:39:52.777
the wage with firm as a

730
00:39:52.777 --> 00:39:55.737
group instead of one person,

731
00:39:55.977 --> 00:39:57.818
one individual each,

732
00:39:58.538 --> 00:40:01.098
then they will actually have more

733
00:40:01.098 --> 00:40:03.898
bargaining power because

734
00:40:04.058 --> 00:40:06.658
they can actually put more

735
00:40:06.658 --> 00:40:09.338
threats to the firm that OK if.

736
00:40:09.738 --> 00:40:12.538
The firm is not agreeing this

737
00:40:12.538 --> 00:40:15.258
wage to all of us

738
00:40:15.738 --> 00:40:18.698
as a group, then

739
00:40:18.858 --> 00:40:21.818
we will we as a group will find

740
00:40:21.818 --> 00:40:24.698
another firm, right?When

741
00:40:24.698 --> 00:40:27.618
you're negotiating with the firm

742
00:40:27.618 --> 00:40:30.538
one versus one, then firm

743
00:40:31.658 --> 00:40:34.618
can actually easy to find other

744
00:40:34.618 --> 00:40:36.738
people to to replace you if.

745
00:40:37.498 --> 00:40:40.059
Both of you cannot agree with a good

746
00:40:40.059 --> 00:40:42.939
price, right?But it is very

747
00:40:42.939 --> 00:40:45.339
hard for a firm to actually all of a

748
00:40:45.339 --> 00:40:48.299
sudden find a replacement for 10

749
00:40:48.379 --> 00:40:49.739
people, for 20 people.

750
00:40:51.259 --> 00:40:53.499
OK, that's the reason

751
00:40:55.659 --> 00:40:58.219
in many developed market

752
00:40:59.499 --> 00:41:02.379
you have a labour union or workers union

753
00:41:03.339 --> 00:41:05.259
to to form this collective bargaining,

754
00:41:06.019 --> 00:41:08.699
OK. So if the firm is

755
00:41:08.699 --> 00:41:10.299
harder to find

756
00:41:11.179 --> 00:41:13.659
replacement of multiple people

757
00:41:14.139 --> 00:41:16.219
at the same time, then that group of

758
00:41:16.219 --> 00:41:18.700
people will have more advantage.

759
00:41:19.260 --> 00:41:21.420
The firm will actually willing to pay

760
00:41:21.420 --> 00:41:23.500
higher price, right?And then

761
00:41:24.300 --> 00:41:25.620
and also as a

762
00:41:27.820 --> 00:41:29.500
labor union member,

763
00:41:30.620 --> 00:41:33.420
you will not willing to walk

764
00:41:33.420 --> 00:41:35.740
with a lower price, right?So collective

765
00:41:35.740 --> 00:41:37.740
bargaining. Will increase the

766
00:41:38.300 --> 00:41:38.860
wage, OK.

767
00:41:41.100 --> 00:41:43.260
And as a fact actually Uh European

768
00:41:43.260 --> 00:41:45.340
country will actually have stronger labor

769
00:41:45.340 --> 00:41:47.900
union comparing to

770
00:41:48.340 --> 00:41:50.620
US and the most famous

771
00:41:51.260 --> 00:41:53.900
or the strongest labor union will

772
00:41:53.940 --> 00:41:56.700
be maybe you have heard of it UAW,

773
00:41:57.620 --> 00:42:00.381
Uh United Automobile Walkers actually all

774
00:42:00.381 --> 00:42:03.341
related from Um

775
00:42:04.461 --> 00:42:06.981
from the theDetroit.

776
00:42:13.421 --> 00:42:15.741
Another factor that could also

777
00:42:15.901 --> 00:42:17.701
impact uh

778
00:42:19.901 --> 00:42:22.221
workers willingness to sell of their

779
00:42:22.221 --> 00:42:24.541
labor will be the reservation wage.

780
00:42:25.661 --> 00:42:27.781
OK, so you can think of reservation

781
00:42:28.141 --> 00:42:30.861
wage as an opportunity cost

782
00:42:31.901 --> 00:42:34.221
of the workers. So.

783
00:42:35.741 --> 00:42:38.622
For in terms of workers, you

784
00:42:39.982 --> 00:42:42.942
workers have let's say 8 hours

785
00:42:42.982 --> 00:42:45.582
a day. Either he choose to work for a

786
00:42:45.582 --> 00:42:47.342
company for a wage

787
00:42:48.142 --> 00:42:50.702
or probably he could

788
00:42:51.662 --> 00:42:54.462
set up his own business, right?

789
00:42:54.462 --> 00:42:56.942
So if his second choice

790
00:42:57.822 --> 00:42:59.982
is very high, that means like he has very

791
00:42:59.982 --> 00:43:02.862
high opportunity cost, then he

792
00:43:02.862 --> 00:43:05.742
will be less likely to win. to walk

793
00:43:05.742 --> 00:43:08.702
for a wage so that he

794
00:43:08.702 --> 00:43:11.502
will want to actually walk for a higher

795
00:43:11.502 --> 00:43:13.822
wage, right?So if the uh

796
00:43:15.582 --> 00:43:17.822
market, if the economy gives

797
00:43:19.663 --> 00:43:21.663
people a better

798
00:43:23.343 --> 00:43:25.903
opportunity cost, a better second choice,

799
00:43:26.463 --> 00:43:28.503
then it will actually level up the

800
00:43:29.503 --> 00:43:31.743
wage that workers are asking for,

801
00:43:32.383 --> 00:43:34.943
right?So for example,Think

802
00:43:34.943 --> 00:43:37.743
about the infrastructures. If

803
00:43:38.263 --> 00:43:40.943
um it let's say for a

804
00:43:40.943 --> 00:43:43.103
city that they have a lot of

805
00:43:43.423 --> 00:43:46.183
policy that actually promoting uh

806
00:43:46.183 --> 00:43:48.703
entrepreneurship to start start up your

807
00:43:48.703 --> 00:43:51.303
own business, then people's uh

808
00:43:51.983 --> 00:43:53.183
actually um

809
00:43:55.343 --> 00:43:58.224
willingness to walk will

810
00:43:58.224 --> 00:44:00.944
be higher because

811
00:44:01.224 --> 00:44:03.824
um their wage must. At least

812
00:44:03.824 --> 00:44:06.544
match their opportunity

813
00:44:06.544 --> 00:44:08.784
cost, which is set up their own business,

814
00:44:09.584 --> 00:44:11.624
right?If you have a bad environment to

815
00:44:11.664 --> 00:44:13.264
set up your own business and

816
00:44:15.504 --> 00:44:18.484
getting away. from a firm will be

817
00:44:18.484 --> 00:44:20.724
more stable, then

818
00:44:21.524 --> 00:44:24.084
the basically the opportunity

819
00:44:24.084 --> 00:44:27.004
cost for people will be lower than the

820
00:44:27.004 --> 00:44:29.924
reservation wage will be lower and people

821
00:44:29.924 --> 00:44:32.164
are willing to work for a lower price.

822
00:44:33.084 --> 00:44:35.604
Uh For example, in some

823
00:44:36.484 --> 00:44:39.445
country it will be more ideal to work for

824
00:44:39.765 --> 00:44:42.645
the government, right?That

825
00:44:42.645 --> 00:44:45.445
is basically the reservation

826
00:44:46.005 --> 00:44:47.845
Wage for them will be low

827
00:44:48.645 --> 00:44:50.485
and working for government as you know

828
00:44:50.565 --> 00:44:51.765
and I think

829
00:44:54.285 --> 00:44:56.725
um in comparing to other

830
00:44:56.725 --> 00:44:59.325
jobs in in many of the

831
00:44:59.645 --> 00:45:02.445
economy will be uh lower wage

832
00:45:02.445 --> 00:45:04.365
job OK.

833
00:45:09.765 --> 00:45:12.725
Um, the third factor that could change

834
00:45:12.885 --> 00:45:15.205
people, Uh workers willingness to sell

835
00:45:15.205 --> 00:45:17.685
their labor will be

836
00:45:17.805 --> 00:45:19.366
efficiency wage.

837
00:45:20.806 --> 00:45:23.486
So this is actually a

838
00:45:24.006 --> 00:45:26.086
theory that some company actually believe

839
00:45:27.126 --> 00:45:28.406
that if they

840
00:45:30.006 --> 00:45:32.566
basically pay their worker

841
00:45:33.086 --> 00:45:35.846
very, very well, then they will

842
00:45:36.166 --> 00:45:38.886
they can buy the actual loyalty.

843
00:45:39.766 --> 00:45:42.726
And the lecture productivity of

844
00:45:42.726 --> 00:45:43.646
the labor because like

845
00:45:46.406 --> 00:45:48.366
this job is actually higher than the

846
00:45:48.566 --> 00:45:50.846
market equilibrium. So people will more

847
00:45:50.846 --> 00:45:53.686
likely to stay on this job, right. They

848
00:45:53.686 --> 00:45:56.326
become more loyal and they are

849
00:45:56.326 --> 00:45:59.207
actually paid. So they're in a

850
00:45:59.207 --> 00:46:01.447
better mood. So they are, they will be

851
00:46:01.447 --> 00:46:03.927
more productive and also they would need

852
00:46:03.927 --> 00:46:06.807
to prove themselves towards

853
00:46:07.047 --> 00:46:08.767
this job.

854
00:46:09.927 --> 00:46:12.247
Other than that, otherwise the firm will

855
00:46:12.247 --> 00:46:15.167
actually replace them, right?Because this

856
00:46:15.167 --> 00:46:16.887
is a job that everyone wants,

857
00:46:18.007 --> 00:46:20.727
so the productivity will be higher.

858
00:46:21.847 --> 00:46:24.327
OK, This will actually also change the

859
00:46:24.327 --> 00:46:27.127
people's willingness to pay, right?If

860
00:46:27.767 --> 00:46:30.727
more more firms are believing are

861
00:46:30.727 --> 00:46:33.287
actually establishing

862
00:46:33.287 --> 00:46:35.527
this efficiency wage,

863
00:46:37.207 --> 00:46:39.848
then. Um, people's willingness to

864
00:46:40.008 --> 00:46:42.968
walk will be higher as well. So for

865
00:46:42.968 --> 00:46:44.408
example, um,

866
00:46:46.328 --> 00:46:47.768
many tech firms

867
00:46:48.968 --> 00:46:51.848
are promoting their culture

868
00:46:51.848 --> 00:46:54.288
that they are. They can um,

869
00:46:56.408 --> 00:46:58.408
they they allow for flexible walking

870
00:46:58.408 --> 00:47:01.128
hours. They can dress very

871
00:47:01.128 --> 00:47:03.928
casually to walk. They can have

872
00:47:04.248 --> 00:47:06.928
snacks. during walks and they're

873
00:47:06.928 --> 00:47:09.528
actually supplying snacks for

874
00:47:09.528 --> 00:47:12.488
free or even meal for free to

875
00:47:12.488 --> 00:47:14.328
the walkers. They are allowed to bring

876
00:47:14.328 --> 00:47:16.768
their pets to

877
00:47:16.888 --> 00:47:19.769
walk. All this culture is

878
00:47:19.769 --> 00:47:22.409
actually part within

879
00:47:22.729 --> 00:47:23.129
this

880
00:47:25.689 --> 00:47:28.329
efficiency wage theories like

881
00:47:29.049 --> 00:47:31.209
these are notDirectly

882
00:47:31.529 --> 00:47:33.929
monetize benefit, but

883
00:47:34.169 --> 00:47:36.409
actually benefits that can change

884
00:47:36.409 --> 00:47:38.889
people's productivity and welfare,

885
00:47:39.929 --> 00:47:42.329
right?For people who value this,

886
00:47:44.489 --> 00:47:47.369
it is at least as if the

887
00:47:47.369 --> 00:47:49.449
firm is actually paying extra money.

888
00:47:52.009 --> 00:47:54.169
It's to them. OK,

889
00:47:56.089 --> 00:47:58.810
so this theory is actually developed

890
00:47:58.810 --> 00:48:01.170
by the Ford Motor. A

891
00:48:01.290 --> 00:48:03.930
company either by

892
00:48:03.930 --> 00:48:06.490
Henry Ford, right. They basically pay

893
00:48:09.850 --> 00:48:12.410
two times of the market's

894
00:48:13.770 --> 00:48:16.450
wage to their workers and that

895
00:48:16.450 --> 00:48:19.050
actually creates partially.

896
00:48:19.050 --> 00:48:21.770
This is also the reason that creates the

897
00:48:21.770 --> 00:48:24.010
Ford miracle that they are

898
00:48:24.330 --> 00:48:26.530
selling them the.

899
00:48:27.530 --> 00:48:30.330
most sold car model in the world,

900
00:48:30.650 --> 00:48:33.290
right?And more and more

901
00:48:33.290 --> 00:48:36.250
talented workers are flooded to

902
00:48:37.050 --> 00:48:39.611
to Detroit to be in the Ford

903
00:48:40.171 --> 00:48:40.651
County.

904
00:48:43.291 --> 00:48:45.611
Okay, so these are

905
00:48:46.051 --> 00:48:48.971
three factors that

906
00:48:50.251 --> 00:48:52.891
would change the labor

907
00:48:52.891 --> 00:48:55.371
supply, but here,

908
00:48:58.051 --> 00:49:00.491
We will talk about the labor

909
00:49:00.491 --> 00:49:03.371
supply completely build up the model

910
00:49:03.611 --> 00:49:06.571
from the scratch. OK, so

911
00:49:07.691 --> 00:49:10.611
here is the situation. We want

912
00:49:10.611 --> 00:49:11.931
to write a

913
00:49:14.091 --> 00:49:16.891
description of how wage

914
00:49:16.971 --> 00:49:19.292
is determined in the market.

915
00:49:19.852 --> 00:49:22.812
So the wage here will be the price of

916
00:49:22.812 --> 00:49:25.772
the. price of the

917
00:49:25.772 --> 00:49:27.612
surveys people are selling, like their

918
00:49:27.612 --> 00:49:30.092
labor. And

919
00:49:31.332 --> 00:49:34.172
here the wage

920
00:49:34.172 --> 00:49:35.852
is more, it's

921
00:49:39.212 --> 00:49:41.772
the willingness to sell.

922
00:49:49.132 --> 00:49:51.652
Because wage determination, although it

923
00:49:51.652 --> 00:49:54.012
is not exactly as the

924
00:49:54.412 --> 00:49:56.812
labor supply,

925
00:49:57.612 --> 00:49:59.053
but it's actually

926
00:50:00.373 --> 00:50:02.333
alternate form of labor supply.

927
00:50:21.343 --> 00:50:23.343
OK, we are actually describing

928
00:50:24.303 --> 00:50:27.263
the people's willingness

929
00:50:27.263 --> 00:50:29.583
to sell depends on

930
00:50:30.783 --> 00:50:33.583
the all the relevant factors. OK, so

931
00:50:33.583 --> 00:50:36.463
there's three different factors.

932
00:50:37.743 --> 00:50:40.624
First of all, the willingness to sell

933
00:50:42.304 --> 00:50:45.184
will depends on the expected

934
00:50:45.184 --> 00:50:48.014
price. So it will

935
00:50:48.014 --> 00:50:50.654
depends possibly on the expected price

936
00:50:50.654 --> 00:50:51.454
level. So

937
00:50:53.134 --> 00:50:55.414
basically that is coming from if

938
00:50:58.014 --> 00:51:00.894
the if the workers are expecting

939
00:51:01.534 --> 00:51:03.534
the overall price level will be higher

940
00:51:04.174 --> 00:51:07.014
for the economy, that means for them the

941
00:51:08.174 --> 00:51:10.334
cost of living will be higher, so they

942
00:51:10.334 --> 00:51:13.294
will have to request a higher

943
00:51:13.454 --> 00:51:16.414
wage. OK. They they

944
00:51:17.054 --> 00:51:19.855
their willingness to sell

945
00:51:20.655 --> 00:51:23.615
their labor at a higher price.

946
00:51:25.215 --> 00:51:28.175
OK. So it is possibly related

947
00:51:28.175 --> 00:51:29.375
to the wage.

948
00:51:31.375 --> 00:51:33.535
And the second factor will be the most

949
00:51:33.535 --> 00:51:36.215
important factor will be the

950
00:51:36.415 --> 00:51:39.375
unemployment rate. It's the unemployment

951
00:51:39.375 --> 00:51:41.335
rate actually is related to the

952
00:51:43.215 --> 00:51:45.055
quantity of labor supply.

953
00:51:46.335 --> 00:51:48.415
We will divide you ohh

954
00:51:50.015 --> 00:51:51.535
later at the end.

955
00:51:55.055 --> 00:51:57.055
So how would the unemployment rate

956
00:51:57.615 --> 00:51:58.936
relate to the

957
00:52:00.176 --> 00:52:02.816
workers willing to sell?OK, that's

958
00:52:04.016 --> 00:52:06.976
will actually require us to go

959
00:52:06.976 --> 00:52:09.536
back to this geograph. OK,

960
00:52:09.856 --> 00:52:11.936
higher unemployment rate means

961
00:52:12.896 --> 00:52:14.816
labor market is more competitive.

962
00:52:15.856 --> 00:52:17.696
It is harder to find a job,

963
00:52:19.136 --> 00:52:21.616
higher unemployment rate, labor market

964
00:52:21.616 --> 00:52:24.536
more competitive, easier to

965
00:52:24.536 --> 00:52:25.216
lose a job.

966
00:52:27.616 --> 00:52:28.816
So from this logic,

967
00:52:32.216 --> 00:52:34.656
OK, so let's go, let's see this

968
00:52:36.096 --> 00:52:38.897
together. So when unemployment rate is

969
00:52:38.897 --> 00:52:40.817
high, that means

970
00:52:41.937 --> 00:52:43.697
less people already got a job.

971
00:52:45.937 --> 00:52:47.857
Right. Unemployment rate is very high.

972
00:52:47.857 --> 00:52:49.457
Many people are not having a job,

973
00:52:51.217 --> 00:52:53.777
so that means less people have a job. OK.

974
00:52:55.137 --> 00:52:57.777
And that also means more people are

975
00:52:57.777 --> 00:53:00.577
available for a job. But

976
00:53:00.577 --> 00:53:01.937
this is in a very

977
00:53:04.017 --> 00:53:06.817
fierce situation, very brutal

978
00:53:06.817 --> 00:53:09.617
situation. There are more

979
00:53:09.617 --> 00:53:11.457
condition in the labor market.

980
00:53:12.657 --> 00:53:15.537
Unemployed workers are more willing to

981
00:53:15.537 --> 00:53:17.217
work for lower wage.

982
00:53:18.898 --> 00:53:20.658
OK, so the logic is like this.

983
00:53:21.778 --> 00:53:23.618
You face a lot of competition. Many

984
00:53:23.618 --> 00:53:26.018
people are in the same shoe as you

985
00:53:26.018 --> 00:53:28.978
fighting for a job. In order for you

986
00:53:28.978 --> 00:53:30.818
to pick up like all else equal, like

987
00:53:32.258 --> 00:53:34.738
all these peoples are having the same

988
00:53:34.738 --> 00:53:36.658
abilities, same education level, same

989
00:53:36.658 --> 00:53:37.938
experiences. OK,

990
00:53:39.698 --> 00:53:42.658
even. That's why the friend choose you

991
00:53:42.658 --> 00:53:45.218
instead of him. So

992
00:53:46.738 --> 00:53:48.658
he choose you because you are willing to

993
00:53:48.658 --> 00:53:51.618
walk for a lower price. Or else equal, if

994
00:53:52.498 --> 00:53:54.898
the guy is willing to walk for a lower

995
00:53:54.898 --> 00:53:56.898
price, then the friend is going to get

996
00:53:56.978 --> 00:53:59.219
picked. So this

997
00:54:00.099 --> 00:54:01.379
is when you is high,

998
00:54:03.059 --> 00:54:05.779
workers will be more willing to

999
00:54:05.779 --> 00:54:08.619
walk for a lower wage.

1000
00:54:09.979 --> 00:54:12.899
Basically, if you got higher,

1001
00:54:14.979 --> 00:54:17.539
then the

1002
00:54:17.539 --> 00:54:19.139
wage they're asking

1003
00:54:20.739 --> 00:54:21.459
will be lower.

1004
00:54:23.459 --> 00:54:24.819
U is unemployment rate.

1005
00:54:26.579 --> 00:54:28.259
OK, let me be precise.

1006
00:54:31.859 --> 00:54:31.979
OK,

1007
00:54:35.379 --> 00:54:36.979
so this is this situation.

1008
00:54:41.620 --> 00:54:44.100
On the contrary, when unemployment rate

1009
00:54:44.100 --> 00:54:44.740
is low,

1010
00:54:48.100 --> 00:54:49.500
so these are all your rates,

1011
00:54:51.940 --> 00:54:54.580
unemployment rates. When

1012
00:54:54.620 --> 00:54:57.460
unemployment rate is low, that means

1013
00:54:59.220 --> 00:55:00.900
more people already got a job,

1014
00:55:02.180 --> 00:55:04.980
right?And also from the other side, less

1015
00:55:04.980 --> 00:55:07.140
people. will be available for a job.

1016
00:55:08.500 --> 00:55:11.220
And that's you have a very good market

1017
00:55:11.220 --> 00:55:13.260
scenario, less competition in the labor

1018
00:55:13.260 --> 00:55:15.620
market. And

1019
00:55:15.620 --> 00:55:18.500
when there's

1020
00:55:18.500 --> 00:55:19.621
less competition,

1021
00:55:22.021 --> 00:55:24.901
everyone wants to actually ask for a

1022
00:55:24.901 --> 00:55:25.701
higher price.

1023
00:55:27.941 --> 00:55:29.901
And workers will be less unemployed,

1024
00:55:29.901 --> 00:55:31.861
workers will be less willing to work for

1025
00:55:31.941 --> 00:55:34.861
a lower wage. Right.

1026
00:55:34.861 --> 00:55:36.421
They don't have that much of the

1027
00:55:36.421 --> 00:55:39.181
competition. They don't need to drop

1028
00:55:39.181 --> 00:55:42.021
down their wage that much. OK,

1029
00:55:43.621 --> 00:55:45.941
so this is

1030
00:55:45.941 --> 00:55:48.901
reflecting a relationship

1031
00:55:48.901 --> 00:55:51.701
like this. When unemployment rate goes

1032
00:55:51.701 --> 00:55:52.421
down,

1033
00:55:55.301 --> 00:55:57.621
actually people are willing to

1034
00:55:57.781 --> 00:56:00.662
ask for a higher wage. The

1035
00:56:00.662 --> 00:56:03.622
workers are willing to sell. Their labor

1036
00:56:03.622 --> 00:56:06.342
at a higher wage. OK, so

1037
00:56:06.822 --> 00:56:09.622
combine this argument together. This

1038
00:56:09.702 --> 00:56:09.942
is a

1039
00:56:12.822 --> 00:56:14.582
negative relationship between the

1040
00:56:14.582 --> 00:56:16.262
unemployment rate and

1041
00:56:17.062 --> 00:56:19.382
wage. Wage is like the

1042
00:56:19.382 --> 00:56:22.182
willingness to sell in in this from

1043
00:56:22.582 --> 00:56:24.742
from from the wage determination part.

1044
00:56:25.862 --> 00:56:27.142
OK, so.

1045
00:56:29.142 --> 00:56:31.982
We decide, OK, we are not specifying the

1046
00:56:31.982 --> 00:56:34.742
exact functional form, but we say this is

1047
00:56:34.742 --> 00:56:37.702
a F function. The argument is

1048
00:56:37.702 --> 00:56:39.943
unemployment rate. It is negatively

1049
00:56:39.943 --> 00:56:42.663
related to the wage that

1050
00:56:42.903 --> 00:56:45.063
people the worker is asking for.

1051
00:56:46.663 --> 00:56:49.543
OK, so

1052
00:56:49.703 --> 00:56:52.423
here I've wrote the unemployment rates.

1053
00:56:52.503 --> 00:56:54.383
Here is actually a measure of the

1054
00:56:54.423 --> 00:56:56.903
competitiveness of the labor market.

1055
00:56:57.543 --> 00:57:00.503
how competitive the labor market

1056
00:57:00.663 --> 00:57:02.743
is. Yeah

1057
00:57:04.503 --> 00:57:06.583
So this is the second variable

1058
00:57:07.103 --> 00:57:09.463
unemployment rate. The third

1059
00:57:10.023 --> 00:57:12.743
will be the catch-all

1060
00:57:12.743 --> 00:57:14.823
variable Z that

1061
00:57:15.303 --> 00:57:16.263
includes

1062
00:57:20.744 --> 00:57:20.864
the

1063
00:57:23.784 --> 00:57:26.624
three other factors. That we

1064
00:57:26.624 --> 00:57:29.384
have talked about collective bargaining,

1065
00:57:30.024 --> 00:57:32.504
reservation wage, efficiency wage. OK,

1066
00:57:33.304 --> 00:57:35.224
let me write it here.

1067
00:57:57.784 --> 00:58:00.105
OK. And they are actually

1068
00:58:00.105 --> 00:58:02.585
positively related to the

1069
00:58:04.425 --> 00:58:07.385
willingness to sell for

1070
00:58:07.385 --> 00:58:10.265
labor. OK. So if you have higher

1071
00:58:11.625 --> 00:58:14.225
stronger labor union, then people

1072
00:58:14.225 --> 00:58:16.745
are actually willingness to

1073
00:58:17.385 --> 00:58:19.225
sell their labor at a higher price,

1074
00:58:20.105 --> 00:58:22.385
right. Same as reservation wage and

1075
00:58:22.385 --> 00:58:25.145
efficiency wage. OK, so

1076
00:58:25.145 --> 00:58:28.025
this together. Composites the

1077
00:58:29.065 --> 00:58:30.345
wage determination

1078
00:58:32.905 --> 00:58:35.745
1/2 part of the

1079
00:58:35.745 --> 00:58:38.025
labor market. OK,

1080
00:58:38.746 --> 00:58:39.786
remember this

1081
00:58:42.506 --> 00:58:45.146
is measuring. You can think of the

1082
00:58:45.146 --> 00:58:47.946
labor supply. So the wage here

1083
00:58:47.946 --> 00:58:50.426
is the willingness to sell. OK,

1084
00:58:50.986 --> 00:58:53.466
basically telling you, let's say for the

1085
00:58:53.466 --> 00:58:56.426
wage is $5. OK,

1086
00:58:56.466 --> 00:58:58.026
$20 per hour.

1087
00:59:01.386 --> 00:59:04.346
This This price

1088
00:59:04.346 --> 00:59:07.306
is actually determined by

1089
00:59:07.546 --> 00:59:10.346
these factors. OK, given these

1090
00:59:10.346 --> 00:59:12.426
factors, for example, the price level

1091
00:59:13.306 --> 00:59:14.826
expected price level is

1092
00:59:18.746 --> 00:59:20.507
$100 in as an

1093
00:59:21.067 --> 00:59:23.627
index value and then.

1094
00:59:23.947 --> 00:59:26.187
Unemployment rate is 5% and then

1095
00:59:26.947 --> 00:59:28.347
all the catch up variable

1096
00:59:30.187 --> 00:59:32.667
standardized to be for example

1097
00:59:33.947 --> 00:59:36.267
one then give you

1098
00:59:37.747 --> 00:59:40.027
all combine the workers combining all

1099
00:59:40.027 --> 00:59:42.787
this factor together produce a

1100
00:59:44.027 --> 00:59:46.147
price of their labor that they are

1101
00:59:46.147 --> 00:59:48.987
willing to sell. OK, so this

1102
00:59:48.987 --> 00:59:51.787
is about the labor supply part

1103
00:59:52.187 --> 00:59:52.907
of the market.

1104
01:00:02.028 --> 01:00:04.548
The next we're going to talk about the

1105
01:00:04.548 --> 01:00:07.388
price determination. By the way,

1106
01:00:08.988 --> 01:00:11.628
these are actually the discussion we have

1107
01:00:11.628 --> 01:00:14.588
talked about, so you can take a

1108
01:00:14.588 --> 01:00:15.388
closer look

1109
01:00:18.348 --> 01:00:21.308
if you have any confusion

1110
01:00:21.308 --> 01:00:23.948
about my explanation. This is the second

1111
01:00:25.268 --> 01:00:26.828
explanation that you can

1112
01:00:27.948 --> 01:00:28.748
find help with.

1113
01:00:32.148 --> 01:00:35.068
Yeah. So for the other part of

1114
01:00:35.068 --> 01:00:37.948
the market, we call

1115
01:00:37.948 --> 01:00:40.669
it price determination. OK. So

1116
01:00:40.909 --> 01:00:43.549
this is actually from the point of view

1117
01:00:43.869 --> 01:00:44.549
of the

1118
01:00:48.349 --> 01:00:49.309
labor demand.

1119
01:00:51.389 --> 01:00:53.629
So who will be the consumer of the labor?

1120
01:00:54.909 --> 01:00:57.709
It'll be firm side.

1121
01:00:58.269 --> 01:01:01.149
So this is from the point of view of

1122
01:01:01.149 --> 01:01:03.549
firms and here let me

1123
01:01:04.429 --> 01:01:07.229
put it out. This is from

1124
01:01:07.389 --> 01:01:08.869
the point of view of the

1125
01:01:10.909 --> 01:01:11.469
worker.

1126
01:01:15.109 --> 01:01:17.709
OK, so from the firm side,

1127
01:01:18.910 --> 01:01:21.150
how as a firm

1128
01:01:21.150 --> 01:01:22.710
determined the

1129
01:01:23.470 --> 01:01:26.310
price that they are

1130
01:01:26.310 --> 01:01:29.230
willing to pay for?the

1131
01:01:29.230 --> 01:01:31.870
workers, the price

1132
01:01:31.870 --> 01:01:34.590
that they are willing to buy

1133
01:01:35.150 --> 01:01:37.070
the labor um

1134
01:01:38.590 --> 01:01:41.150
from workers. So we're going to

1135
01:01:41.150 --> 01:01:43.150
construct their reasoning.

1136
01:01:45.390 --> 01:01:48.350
First of all, we need to, first of all,

1137
01:01:48.350 --> 01:01:51.310
firm is the, I mean

1138
01:01:51.310 --> 01:01:53.310
the the

1139
01:01:53.310 --> 01:01:54.430
fundamental

1140
01:01:55.950 --> 01:01:58.910
work for for firm is actually producing

1141
01:01:58.910 --> 01:02:01.311
goods, right?They're going to produce it

1142
01:02:01.311 --> 01:02:02.831
and going to sell it on the market.

1143
01:02:04.751 --> 01:02:06.351
So we will

1144
01:02:07.231 --> 01:02:09.471
model this production process

1145
01:02:09.871 --> 01:02:12.751
by a production function. So

1146
01:02:13.151 --> 01:02:16.071
Y is the output, to

1147
01:02:16.071 --> 01:02:18.511
be precise, will be the quantity of

1148
01:02:18.511 --> 01:02:19.951
output, number of

1149
01:02:22.911 --> 01:02:25.231
outputs the firm is produced.

1150
01:02:25.871 --> 01:02:28.271
OK. And this production

1151
01:02:29.871 --> 01:02:32.831
only using labor.

1152
01:02:34.951 --> 01:02:36.111
Um All the other

1153
01:02:38.111 --> 01:02:40.752
inputs for production will be

1154
01:02:41.552 --> 01:02:43.792
captured by this A.

1155
01:02:44.392 --> 01:02:44.672
OK.

1156
01:02:47.792 --> 01:02:50.512
So this production is

1157
01:02:50.512 --> 01:02:53.312
telling you, given this number

1158
01:02:53.872 --> 01:02:56.192
of workers,And with the

1159
01:02:56.192 --> 01:02:58.592
technology and other

1160
01:03:00.032 --> 01:03:02.272
capitals all

1161
01:03:03.312 --> 01:03:05.512
stacking together, OK, we have a

1162
01:03:06.592 --> 01:03:08.192
labor productivity A

1163
01:03:10.992 --> 01:03:13.552
these two times together. So this is the

1164
01:03:13.552 --> 01:03:15.472
labor productivity telling you

1165
01:03:17.632 --> 01:03:20.593
how many of the output can one worker is

1166
01:03:20.593 --> 01:03:22.753
produced times the number of workers

1167
01:03:22.753 --> 01:03:25.713
working for the firm. together generates

1168
01:03:25.953 --> 01:03:28.593
the white, the number of outputs

1169
01:03:28.913 --> 01:03:31.393
that a firm can produce. So this is the

1170
01:03:31.473 --> 01:03:34.393
production function. The

1171
01:03:34.393 --> 01:03:36.033
production function is the relation

1172
01:03:36.553 --> 01:03:38.753
between the inputs used in production and

1173
01:03:38.753 --> 01:03:40.233
the quantity of output produced

1174
01:03:42.153 --> 01:03:44.193
on the price of these inputs.

1175
01:03:46.063 --> 01:03:48.583
If we assume that A is constant

1176
01:03:48.783 --> 01:03:51.583
to simplify our model

1177
01:03:52.223 --> 01:03:54.463
and also A equals to one,

1178
01:03:55.023 --> 01:03:56.703
then the production function is

1179
01:03:56.703 --> 01:03:59.664
essentially the number of output

1180
01:03:59.664 --> 01:04:02.304
equals to the number of labor inputs.

1181
01:04:03.744 --> 01:04:06.184
OK, which implies that the cost of

1182
01:04:06.184 --> 01:04:08.624
producing one more unit of

1183
01:04:08.624 --> 01:04:11.424
output is the cost of employing

1184
01:04:11.824 --> 01:04:14.624
one more worker. at

1185
01:04:14.704 --> 01:04:17.584
wage W. How you

1186
01:04:17.584 --> 01:04:19.824
get from this?So

1187
01:04:20.304 --> 01:04:22.625
at current level, we are

1188
01:04:22.625 --> 01:04:24.505
producing with

1189
01:04:25.585 --> 01:04:28.225
N number of workers, we are producing Y

1190
01:04:28.225 --> 01:04:30.945
number of outputs. For one

1191
01:04:30.945 --> 01:04:33.585
extra worker, we can produce

1192
01:04:34.225 --> 01:04:36.705
Y plus 1, so one

1193
01:04:36.705 --> 01:04:39.425
extra unit of output. So the

1194
01:04:39.425 --> 01:04:42.145
marginal product will bethe new

1195
01:04:42.145 --> 01:04:43.986
product minus the old product, which is

1196
01:04:43.986 --> 01:04:46.866
1, marginal labor inputs will be the

1197
01:04:46.866 --> 01:04:49.826
new labor input minus the

1198
01:04:49.826 --> 01:04:52.626
original level, which is also

1199
01:04:52.626 --> 01:04:54.946
1. That actually implies

1200
01:04:55.426 --> 01:04:57.626
that the marginal cost, which is the

1201
01:04:58.066 --> 01:05:00.306
marginal cost of producing one extra

1202
01:05:00.386 --> 01:05:03.106
output, will be the unit

1203
01:05:03.106 --> 01:05:05.907
cost of labor, which is W,

1204
01:05:06.307 --> 01:05:09.187
times the marginal labor inputs.

1205
01:05:09.707 --> 01:05:11.907
which in this case is one.

1206
01:05:13.747 --> 01:05:16.467
And that's derived the

1207
01:05:16.467 --> 01:05:18.547
module cost will be W,

1208
01:05:19.587 --> 01:05:21.587
which is here.

1209
01:05:24.067 --> 01:05:25.988
So now um

1210
01:05:28.148 --> 01:05:30.788
we still thinking about from the

1211
01:05:30.948 --> 01:05:33.828
firm's perspective that how

1212
01:05:33.828 --> 01:05:35.708
he actually going to set the

1213
01:05:36.308 --> 01:05:39.268
wage that the firm is willing

1214
01:05:39.588 --> 01:05:41.828
to sell, sorry, willing to buy

1215
01:05:42.788 --> 01:05:45.108
is from this relationship. So

1216
01:05:45.908 --> 01:05:47.429
P is the

1217
01:05:48.869 --> 01:05:51.749
price that the product

1218
01:05:51.989 --> 01:05:54.709
could be sold. OK, so the

1219
01:05:54.709 --> 01:05:57.029
firm is, for this actual

1220
01:06:00.309 --> 01:06:03.109
labor input one, OK, he will

1221
01:06:03.109 --> 01:06:05.829
produce actual one unit

1222
01:06:05.909 --> 01:06:08.880
of output. This will bring1 *

1223
01:06:09.270 --> 01:06:11.430
P amount of benefits

1224
01:06:12.870 --> 01:06:15.830
and the cost for him is actually

1225
01:06:15.830 --> 01:06:18.790
W and 1 + m is measuring

1226
01:06:19.830 --> 01:06:21.870
how far it is from the

1227
01:06:22.550 --> 01:06:24.910
benefits comparing to the

1228
01:06:25.110 --> 01:06:27.110
cost of firm, right?

1229
01:06:27.830 --> 01:06:29.831
Remember firm is

1230
01:06:32.871 --> 01:06:35.511
hiring worker.

1231
01:06:39.511 --> 01:06:42.231
With wage W

1232
01:06:43.431 --> 01:06:45.991
and selling products

1233
01:06:48.311 --> 01:06:49.191
or outputs

1234
01:06:52.152 --> 01:06:54.232
at price

1235
01:06:55.912 --> 01:06:58.712
P OK, the

1236
01:06:58.712 --> 01:07:01.552
P is in a very

1237
01:07:01.552 --> 01:07:02.392
general sense the

1238
01:07:03.912 --> 01:07:06.432
general. price level of the

1239
01:07:06.432 --> 01:07:09.032
economy. OK,

1240
01:07:09.032 --> 01:07:11.632
so to link the

1241
01:07:12.232 --> 01:07:14.713
module benefits and the modular cost

1242
01:07:15.153 --> 01:07:16.953
of the firm is by this

1243
01:07:18.073 --> 01:07:20.633
variable called markup.

1244
01:07:21.993 --> 01:07:24.233
So basically, one plus this markup is

1245
01:07:24.233 --> 01:07:26.673
measuring how distant the

1246
01:07:28.313 --> 01:07:30.513
the module benefit versus the module cost

1247
01:07:30.513 --> 01:07:32.393
of a firm, basically measuring

1248
01:07:33.713 --> 01:07:34.234
um the

1249
01:07:36.794 --> 01:07:39.754
The the gap between the marginal benefit

1250
01:07:39.754 --> 01:07:42.394
and the marginal cost. If

1251
01:07:42.474 --> 01:07:45.354
M is larger, that means the firm

1252
01:07:45.354 --> 01:07:47.034
will have bigger

1253
01:07:47.914 --> 01:07:49.354
profit space.

1254
01:07:51.674 --> 01:07:54.594
OK, so this markup actually

1255
01:07:54.594 --> 01:07:57.195
depends. This actually measures the

1256
01:07:59.435 --> 01:08:00.235
product

1257
01:08:02.875 --> 01:08:05.595
output. OK. the output

1258
01:08:06.155 --> 01:08:06.875
market

1259
01:08:11.035 --> 01:08:12.075
competitiveness.

1260
01:08:17.906 --> 01:08:18.866
So if

1261
01:08:23.026 --> 01:08:25.666
M is higher, that

1262
01:08:25.666 --> 01:08:28.386
means the product market

1263
01:08:28.386 --> 01:08:29.026
is

1264
01:08:36.216 --> 01:08:38.697
more or less

1265
01:08:38.937 --> 01:08:39.657
competitive.

1266
01:08:47.517 --> 01:08:48.797
So the idea is

1267
01:08:51.117 --> 01:08:53.837
if the product market is

1268
01:08:54.077 --> 01:08:56.237
more competitive, so it's

1269
01:08:56.557 --> 01:08:58.637
basically similar logic of the labor

1270
01:08:58.637 --> 01:09:01.558
market competitives. So if the product

1271
01:09:01.558 --> 01:09:03.678
market is more competitive, that means

1272
01:09:03.678 --> 01:09:06.638
there are many other firms that

1273
01:09:06.638 --> 01:09:08.158
producing same product.

1274
01:09:09.678 --> 01:09:12.558
Then naturally if you want to win the

1275
01:09:12.558 --> 01:09:14.398
purchase then you have to lower the

1276
01:09:14.398 --> 01:09:16.238
price, right?The

1277
01:09:18.958 --> 01:09:21.119
that means you will have

1278
01:09:21.279 --> 01:09:23.759
less profit margin.

1279
01:09:24.479 --> 01:09:27.119
That means the markup will

1280
01:09:27.119 --> 01:09:30.079
be lower, right?So

1281
01:09:30.079 --> 01:09:32.079
if the markup is higher, that means the

1282
01:09:32.079 --> 01:09:34.719
product market is less competitive.

1283
01:09:36.879 --> 01:09:39.359
OK. So

1284
01:09:39.919 --> 01:09:41.839
the markup is.

1285
01:09:43.360 --> 01:09:45.200
Measure of the product market

1286
01:09:45.200 --> 01:09:47.440
competitiveness so that

1287
01:09:48.280 --> 01:09:51.240
it is defined, it is decided by the

1288
01:09:51.520 --> 01:09:54.360
product market. OK. So it

1289
01:09:54.360 --> 01:09:57.040
is not decided by the

1290
01:09:57.360 --> 01:09:59.680
labor market. The labor market decides

1291
01:09:59.680 --> 01:10:02.320
the wage

1292
01:10:02.880 --> 01:10:03.720
from the

1293
01:10:05.841 --> 01:10:08.481
prices determination and the wage

1294
01:10:08.481 --> 01:10:10.601
determination. OK.

1295
01:10:12.481 --> 01:10:13.601
So let's move on

1296
01:10:15.761 --> 01:10:18.161
then. So

1297
01:10:18.161 --> 01:10:19.681
basically here we've

1298
01:10:22.001 --> 01:10:24.721
determined the price and determined the

1299
01:10:24.721 --> 01:10:27.562
wage. And now we will just put

1300
01:10:27.562 --> 01:10:29.842
these two together

1301
01:10:32.162 --> 01:10:34.802
to find the equilibrium. So there's some

1302
01:10:34.882 --> 01:10:37.842
kind of preparation first of all,

1303
01:10:40.082 --> 01:10:42.322
we. Because

1304
01:10:43.922 --> 01:10:46.482
let's recall that equation

1305
01:10:46.482 --> 01:10:49.283
7.1, which is the wage

1306
01:10:49.283 --> 01:10:51.363
determination that

1307
01:10:51.763 --> 01:10:52.563
is

1308
01:10:56.803 --> 01:10:58.403
the willingness to sell

1309
01:11:00.683 --> 01:11:02.723
of labor depends on the price

1310
01:11:02.723 --> 01:11:05.203
expectation times the F function

1311
01:11:06.283 --> 01:11:09.164
depends on U&Z positive,

1312
01:11:09.684 --> 01:11:12.644
sorry, negative and positively. related.

1313
01:11:15.604 --> 01:11:18.204
And here we assume that the

1314
01:11:18.204 --> 01:11:21.124
expected price level is the actual

1315
01:11:21.124 --> 01:11:23.524
price level. So basically people are

1316
01:11:23.524 --> 01:11:26.004
making perfect expectation.

1317
01:11:38.045 --> 01:11:40.605
When in this condition, OK,

1318
01:11:40.845 --> 01:11:43.725
we derive the real wage, so which

1319
01:11:43.725 --> 01:11:46.525
is W over the price level

1320
01:11:47.085 --> 01:11:50.045
as a F function.

1321
01:11:50.765 --> 01:11:52.006
Depends on UNZ.

1322
01:11:54.566 --> 01:11:56.686
And then we also need to change the

1323
01:11:57.686 --> 01:12:00.446
price determination, do some

1324
01:12:00.446 --> 01:12:03.206
manipulation, OK, write it

1325
01:12:03.206 --> 01:12:05.926
in terms of real wage as well. The real

1326
01:12:07.366 --> 01:12:09.926
price of Labor that the firm is

1327
01:12:10.406 --> 01:12:12.967
willingness to buy OK depends on

1328
01:12:12.967 --> 01:12:15.447
1 / 1 plus the markup.

1329
01:12:16.967 --> 01:12:18.887
So put these two equations together.

1330
01:12:20.487 --> 01:12:23.447
On the graph that have the Y axis

1331
01:12:23.687 --> 01:12:25.447
in terms of real wage,

1332
01:12:26.567 --> 01:12:29.287
X axis in terms of unemployment rate.

1333
01:12:29.767 --> 01:12:32.487
OK, so the wage setting determination.

1334
01:12:32.567 --> 01:12:35.488
Wage setting is basically the sorry, the

1335
01:12:35.528 --> 01:12:37.368
wage determination. OK.

1336
01:12:39.068 --> 01:12:41.468
So the willingness to sell of

1337
01:12:41.628 --> 01:12:44.508
labour from workers depends on

1338
01:12:45.068 --> 01:12:47.388
the F function which is negatively

1339
01:12:47.388 --> 01:12:50.188
related to you. So in terms of

1340
01:12:50.948 --> 01:12:53.228
unemployment rate you the

1341
01:12:53.948 --> 01:12:56.509
the curve which setting is

1342
01:12:56.509 --> 01:12:59.229
downward sloping and

1343
01:12:59.229 --> 01:13:01.389
then on the other side of the market

1344
01:13:01.869 --> 01:13:04.669
about the willingness to buy labour from

1345
01:13:04.669 --> 01:13:07.629
the. willingness to buy

1346
01:13:07.629 --> 01:13:08.269
labor,

1347
01:13:10.509 --> 01:13:12.269
which is the real

1348
01:13:12.669 --> 01:13:15.629
price equals

1349
01:13:15.629 --> 01:13:18.270
to 1 over 1 plus markup,

1350
01:13:18.510 --> 01:13:20.630
which is independent of the

1351
01:13:21.030 --> 01:13:22.750
unemployment rate. So it will become a

1352
01:13:22.750 --> 01:13:25.110
flat horizontal line,

1353
01:13:26.590 --> 01:13:28.790
which the level is marked by the

1354
01:13:29.710 --> 01:13:30.270
markup.

1355
01:13:32.910 --> 01:13:35.230
OK, and putting these two together,

1356
01:13:35.950 --> 01:13:37.550
Remember, we are making

1357
01:13:39.231 --> 01:13:40.591
assumption of

1358
01:13:42.191 --> 01:13:44.991
the expected price is the actual price

1359
01:13:44.991 --> 01:13:47.071
that people make perfect expectation.

1360
01:13:48.431 --> 01:13:51.391
And this equilibrium we find is actually

1361
01:13:51.391 --> 01:13:52.911
the medium run equilibrium

1362
01:13:55.231 --> 01:13:58.071
that OK, at

1363
01:13:58.071 --> 01:14:00.752
this level we will find the medium

1364
01:14:00.752 --> 01:14:03.392
run equilibrium level of

1365
01:14:03.392 --> 01:14:05.712
unemployment UN.

1366
01:14:06.592 --> 01:14:08.152
It is also called

1367
01:14:10.912 --> 01:14:13.392
the natural rate of unemployment or we

1368
01:14:13.392 --> 01:14:15.392
call structural rate of unemployment.

1369
01:14:16.832 --> 01:14:18.752
So this is a special

1370
01:14:20.232 --> 01:14:22.433
equilibrium which is medium run

1371
01:14:22.473 --> 01:14:24.993
equilibrium that people make perfect

1372
01:14:24.993 --> 01:14:27.553
expectation. OK.

1373
01:14:28.113 --> 01:14:30.913
And in another words, the economy

1374
01:14:30.913 --> 01:14:32.513
is at its potential,

1375
01:14:34.193 --> 01:14:34.833
so.

1376
01:14:37.473 --> 01:14:40.113
The equilibrium unemployment

1377
01:14:40.113 --> 01:14:42.994
rates when

1378
01:14:42.994 --> 01:14:45.954
the people make perfect expectation is

1379
01:14:45.954 --> 01:14:48.114
called the natural rate. OK, we will also

1380
01:14:48.114 --> 01:14:50.914
have the equilibrium

1381
01:14:50.914 --> 01:14:52.834
total output in natural rate, but

1382
01:14:54.194 --> 01:14:57.114
that will be decided by the ISLM

1383
01:14:57.114 --> 01:14:59.874
model incorporated with the labor market

1384
01:14:59.874 --> 01:15:02.034
equilibrium, which we will introduce

1385
01:15:02.034 --> 01:15:04.995
later. but just natural in

1386
01:15:04.995 --> 01:15:06.835
advance that um

1387
01:15:07.995 --> 01:15:09.755
equilibrium output will also have the

1388
01:15:09.875 --> 01:15:11.075
so-called natural rate.

1389
01:15:13.795 --> 01:15:16.595
Um Here is basically

1390
01:15:17.075 --> 01:15:19.955
we have covered the determination of

1391
01:15:19.955 --> 01:15:21.155
the price setting.

1392
01:15:27.776 --> 01:15:30.376
So let's follow up about the

1393
01:15:31.696 --> 01:15:32.576
natural rate.

1394
01:15:37.236 --> 01:15:40.196
So basically the

1395
01:15:40.196 --> 01:15:42.836
fundamental idea is

1396
01:15:44.516 --> 01:15:46.837
when the

1397
01:15:47.997 --> 01:15:50.477
expected price level is the

1398
01:15:50.757 --> 01:15:53.277
actual price level, then the economy is

1399
01:15:53.277 --> 01:15:54.917
in the medium run equilibrium.

1400
01:15:57.477 --> 01:15:59.717
In short run, OK, the price level could

1401
01:15:59.717 --> 01:16:02.677
be different or the same. as

1402
01:16:02.757 --> 01:16:05.477
the expected price level, like people may

1403
01:16:05.477 --> 01:16:08.278
guess it correct or guess it wrong. If

1404
01:16:08.278 --> 01:16:10.438
they guess it correct, then this

1405
01:16:11.078 --> 01:16:13.638
short-run equilibrium is automatically

1406
01:16:13.878 --> 01:16:16.598
also be the medium-run equilibrium.

1407
01:16:17.958 --> 01:16:20.758
But if they if people guess it wrong, so

1408
01:16:20.758 --> 01:16:23.638
the expected price level would

1409
01:16:23.638 --> 01:16:26.358
not be the actual price level, then

1410
01:16:26.838 --> 01:16:29.639
the economy is not at medium-run

1411
01:16:29.639 --> 01:16:30.439
equilibrium, but

1412
01:16:33.239 --> 01:16:35.279
It is still the in the

1413
01:16:35.799 --> 01:16:36.799
short-run equilibrium.

1414
01:16:39.559 --> 01:16:42.519
The equilibrium level is actually

1415
01:16:42.519 --> 01:16:44.199
the short-run equilibrium level.

1416
01:16:45.639 --> 01:16:46.039
So

1417
01:16:48.919 --> 01:16:50.039
to summarize,

1418
01:16:55.540 --> 01:16:57.620
OK, then

1419
01:17:01.220 --> 01:17:03.060
the short-run equilibrium

1420
01:17:03.940 --> 01:17:04.980
is also.

1421
01:17:06.520 --> 01:17:08.680
Medium run equilibrium. So because like

1422
01:17:08.680 --> 01:17:11.080
the economy is basically at the medium

1423
01:17:11.080 --> 01:17:13.241
run level. But if

1424
01:17:17.561 --> 01:17:20.441
not here, then

1425
01:17:22.041 --> 01:17:23.961
the short run equilibrium is not

1426
01:17:27.721 --> 01:17:30.361
medium run equilibrium. OK,

1427
01:17:31.801 --> 01:17:34.762
So what we're going to do next?In Chapter

1428
01:17:34.762 --> 01:17:37.642
8 and 9 is basically

1429
01:17:37.642 --> 01:17:40.202
incorporate the labor

1430
01:17:40.202 --> 01:17:43.082
market into our ISM model

1431
01:17:43.802 --> 01:17:46.602
and we will study first, OK, what

1432
01:17:46.682 --> 01:17:49.642
the economy will

1433
01:17:49.642 --> 01:17:51.722
be doing in medium run equilibria,

1434
01:17:52.562 --> 01:17:55.323
what it really means. OK, we will

1435
01:17:55.483 --> 01:17:58.123
actually revisit some of the ideas

1436
01:17:58.683 --> 01:18:01.403
introduced in this chapter and also we'll

1437
01:18:01.403 --> 01:18:04.243
talk about what if. The

1438
01:18:04.243 --> 01:18:06.723
economy is not at medium run equilibrium

1439
01:18:06.723 --> 01:18:09.243
and what we can do to

1440
01:18:09.363 --> 01:18:12.083
bring the economy back to the medium run

1441
01:18:12.083 --> 01:18:14.763
equilibrium, which is the potential

1442
01:18:14.763 --> 01:18:17.484
level, which is the natural rate

1443
01:18:17.524 --> 01:18:20.124
level. OK, so

1444
01:18:20.124 --> 01:18:22.964
that's pretty much the

1445
01:18:23.084 --> 01:18:25.804
overall structure of this chapter.

1446
01:18:26.284 --> 01:18:27.964
Before we conclude,

1447
01:18:29.404 --> 01:18:32.364
I will go back to talk about the labor

1448
01:18:32.364 --> 01:18:35.164
market equilibrium a little bit. So

1449
01:18:39.725 --> 01:18:42.445
as we have discussed,

1450
01:18:43.165 --> 01:18:45.725
let me put it here that the

1451
01:18:45.725 --> 01:18:48.685
price setting is more

1452
01:18:48.685 --> 01:18:49.245
about

1453
01:18:52.605 --> 01:18:53.525
labor demand

1454
01:18:58.045 --> 01:19:00.526
and the wage setting is

1455
01:19:00.966 --> 01:19:03.566
an alternative form of labor supply.

1456
01:19:05.806 --> 01:19:07.246
OK. So then

1457
01:19:08.846 --> 01:19:10.446
you can understand in a way that the

1458
01:19:10.446 --> 01:19:13.326
price setting or the wage setting

1459
01:19:14.366 --> 01:19:15.886
are just another

1460
01:19:16.446 --> 01:19:19.006
representation of the labor demand and

1461
01:19:19.006 --> 01:19:21.087
labor supply. So it is not

1462
01:19:21.407 --> 01:19:24.127
fundamentally different from the basic

1463
01:19:24.127 --> 01:19:26.847
supply and demand model

1464
01:19:27.247 --> 01:19:28.527
that if we have

1465
01:19:31.327 --> 01:19:34.047
change in the variables. that is

1466
01:19:34.047 --> 01:19:37.007
not the unemployment rate or

1467
01:19:37.407 --> 01:19:40.167
not the real wage, then it will

1468
01:19:40.167 --> 01:19:42.448
shift the curves. So

1469
01:19:43.488 --> 01:19:46.328
for example, in this in here, we

1470
01:19:46.328 --> 01:19:48.528
have an increase in unemployment benefit,

1471
01:19:48.528 --> 01:19:51.408
and this is captured by the z variable,

1472
01:19:51.408 --> 01:19:54.048
the catch-up variables in the f

1473
01:19:54.048 --> 01:19:56.368
function. z goes up,

1474
01:19:57.008 --> 01:19:59.808
so that means the wage

1475
01:19:59.888 --> 01:20:02.728
settingWe have Z goes up and

1476
01:20:02.728 --> 01:20:05.089
Z is possibly related to the real wage.

1477
01:20:05.569 --> 01:20:08.049
In that sense we have the wage

1478
01:20:08.049 --> 01:20:10.849
setting shift up OK

1479
01:20:10.849 --> 01:20:13.569
and then we will find a new level of

1480
01:20:14.769 --> 01:20:17.649
medium run unemployment

1481
01:20:18.689 --> 01:20:21.329
rates, medium run

1482
01:20:21.369 --> 01:20:23.409
equilibrium unemployment rate,

1483
01:20:24.329 --> 01:20:27.170
OK and

1484
01:20:28.530 --> 01:20:30.610
or from the other side of the market if.

1485
01:20:30.930 --> 01:20:33.730
So another scenario for an

1486
01:20:33.730 --> 01:20:36.450
increase in the markup. OK, so basically

1487
01:20:36.450 --> 01:20:39.410
we have M goes up, then

1488
01:20:39.650 --> 01:20:41.850
M only appears in the weight of price

1489
01:20:41.850 --> 01:20:44.610
setting. So if M goes up,

1490
01:20:45.250 --> 01:20:48.051
then the whole term will go down

1491
01:20:49.171 --> 01:20:51.891
so that the price setting will

1492
01:20:51.891 --> 01:20:54.691
shift down. That gives you also

1493
01:20:54.691 --> 01:20:57.411
another new medium

1494
01:20:57.411 --> 01:21:00.331
run. Equilibrium level of unemployment

1495
01:21:00.331 --> 01:21:02.011
rate, right?The natural rate of

1496
01:21:02.051 --> 01:21:04.371
unemployment rate will be go up.

1497
01:21:06.251 --> 01:21:08.852
OK, so the idea is the

1498
01:21:08.852 --> 01:21:09.732
same and

1499
01:21:11.812 --> 01:21:14.052
we will apply this method of

1500
01:21:14.452 --> 01:21:17.412
reasoning in analyzing

1501
01:21:17.412 --> 01:21:20.132
the labor market equilibrium.

1502
01:21:21.652 --> 01:21:21.972
OK.

1503
01:21:27.006 --> 01:21:29.847
Okay, I will briefly talk about the

1504
01:21:30.287 --> 01:21:33.247
appendix, about the wish

1505
01:21:33.407 --> 01:21:36.288
and price setting. So,

1506
01:21:39.008 --> 01:21:41.569
basically, how does the,

1507
01:21:42.089 --> 01:21:44.849
what is the relationshipbetween the

1508
01:21:45.169 --> 01:21:46.529
wage setting,

1509
01:21:56.791 --> 01:21:59.631
which is the labor

1510
01:22:00.271 --> 01:22:00.991
supply,

1511
01:22:04.912 --> 01:22:07.712
which is the price setting about

1512
01:22:07.712 --> 01:22:08.672
labor demand.

1513
01:22:14.373 --> 01:22:17.134
OK, so basically the math

1514
01:22:17.414 --> 01:22:19.174
is a little bit of math.

1515
01:22:21.334 --> 01:22:22.854
So unemployment rate

1516
01:22:24.455 --> 01:22:26.935
Is this capital U the amount of

1517
01:22:27.015 --> 01:22:29.975
unemployed people over the amount of

1518
01:22:30.455 --> 01:22:32.456
people that is

1519
01:22:33.856 --> 01:22:36.376
employed that is in the labor

1520
01:22:36.376 --> 01:22:39.057
force?OK, L is the

1521
01:22:39.057 --> 01:22:41.177
labor force, which is

1522
01:22:51.698 --> 01:22:54.259
employed plus the

1523
01:22:55.059 --> 01:22:57.699
unemployed. OK, so in that

1524
01:22:57.699 --> 01:22:59.780
sense, the

1525
01:23:01.540 --> 01:23:04.220
unemployed. Will be

1526
01:23:04.220 --> 01:23:06.861
1 minus employed the L

1527
01:23:06.861 --> 01:23:07.901
minus employed.

1528
01:23:09.741 --> 01:23:12.701
So for the labor supply curve

1529
01:23:13.421 --> 01:23:15.822
building up from the wage setting.

1530
01:23:16.302 --> 01:23:18.102
So we write down the wage setting.

1531
01:23:18.942 --> 01:23:20.863
And the first argument is the

1532
01:23:20.903 --> 01:23:23.663
unemployment rate. We replace it with the

1533
01:23:23.863 --> 01:23:26.783
unemployed over the labor force. And then

1534
01:23:26.783 --> 01:23:29.344
here, we furtherly

1535
01:23:29.344 --> 01:23:32.144
replace it in terms of

1536
01:23:32.784 --> 01:23:34.864
employed people. So ohh

1537
01:23:36.865 --> 01:23:39.705
regarding the

1538
01:23:39.745 --> 01:23:42.546
law of supply, so when the price goes

1539
01:23:42.546 --> 01:23:44.586
up, the

1540
01:23:44.786 --> 01:23:47.706
quantityOf supply,

1541
01:23:47.706 --> 01:23:50.387
which is the amount of employed

1542
01:23:50.387 --> 01:23:52.387
people, right?The quantity of labor

1543
01:23:52.387 --> 01:23:54.147
supplied will goes up.

1544
01:23:56.067 --> 01:23:56.628
So

1545
01:23:58.948 --> 01:24:00.948
the whole argument is in an active

1546
01:24:00.948 --> 01:24:03.509
relationship when W

1547
01:24:03.909 --> 01:24:06.309
goes up that

1548
01:24:06.309 --> 01:24:09.189
actually because we have minus sign

1549
01:24:09.709 --> 01:24:12.270
and this is in the numerator with a minus

1550
01:24:12.270 --> 01:24:14.790
sign, so they actually.

1551
01:24:15.350 --> 01:24:17.591
Have a positive relationship, right?That

1552
01:24:17.591 --> 01:24:19.831
is actually confirming the law of supply.

1553
01:24:20.071 --> 01:24:23.031
So this is I'm proving you the

1554
01:24:23.031 --> 01:24:25.832
wage setting expression is

1555
01:24:25.832 --> 01:24:28.232
some alternate expression

1556
01:24:28.632 --> 01:24:29.912
of the labor supply.

1557
01:24:31.592 --> 01:24:33.913
OK, As for the labor demand,

1558
01:24:34.793 --> 01:24:37.433
which is from the price setting, it

1559
01:24:37.753 --> 01:24:40.234
is from this relation,

1560
01:24:40.474 --> 01:24:42.354
right?If the

1561
01:24:43.034 --> 01:24:44.154
price goes up.

1562
01:24:49.915 --> 01:24:52.475
Then the labor supply,

1563
01:24:53.036 --> 01:24:55.116
sorry, labor here is

1564
01:24:55.116 --> 01:24:58.076
actually not

1565
01:24:58.076 --> 01:25:01.037
depending on the quantity of

1566
01:25:01.437 --> 01:25:03.837
labor demand. It is actually a flat line.

1567
01:25:06.717 --> 01:25:07.038
OK.

1568
01:25:10.078 --> 01:25:12.279
So that's it. Thank you
